**Conflict of Interest in Employment**

The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees, effective
December 8, 1995:

*Standards for hiring, promotion, reappointment, evaluation, working
conditions, responsibilities, salary, and termination for all employees
at Michigan State University are based on ability, qualifications for
the position, and performance. Relationship (meaning connection between
persons, hereinafter referred to as "relatives," by blood, marriage,
adoption, same-sex domestic partnership or other personal relationship
in which objectivity might be impaired) to another individual employed
by the University shall not constitute a bar to hiring, promotion, or
reappointment provided, however, that no employee shall be under the
direct supervision or control of a "relative." Employment of "relatives"
in the same unit or department or under the same supervisor is
authorized only with the prior written approval of the head of the unit
or department and the Office of the Provost or the Office of Human
Resource Services, as appropriate. In addition, "relatives" should not
participate in roles that have the potential for influencing employment
decisions, e.g., peer review.*
