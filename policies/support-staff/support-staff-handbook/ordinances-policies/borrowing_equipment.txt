**Borrowing University Equipment**

University equipment is to be used only for University activities.
Personal use or use for private gain is prohibited. University equipment
must not be loaned to non-campus organizations, except to departments of
the state or federal government under special, approved circumstances.
University policy stipulates that equipment cannot be taken off campus.
Any exception to this policy can only be made with prior written
approval of the chairperson, director, or administrative head, and dean.
The department or unit is responsible for equipment loss or damage.
