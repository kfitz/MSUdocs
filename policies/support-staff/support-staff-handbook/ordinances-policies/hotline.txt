**Hotline for Reporting Misconduct**

Michigan State University has implemented a hotline (1-800-763-0764) and
[web reporting
portal](http://misconduct.msu.edu/ "Web reporting portal") to help
maintain adherence to ethical practices. Both methods are available
24/7/365 and enable one to report known or suspected misconduct at
Michigan State University related to fiscal matters, conflicts of
interest, employment, medical/HIPAA, research, safety, athletics,
discrimination/harassment, privacy, retaliation, or any other area of
legal, policy, or ethical concern not specifically listed. One can
choose to remain anonymous or provide their name and contact
information.

MSU takes all reports of harassment and discrimination, including
relationship violence, and sexual misconduct, seriously. MSU\'s
[Anti-Discrimination
Policy](/policies-procedures/university-wide/ADP_policy.html "Anti-Discrimination Policy")
and [Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct
Policy](/policies-procedures/university-wide/RVSM_policy.html "RVSM Policy")
prohibit discrimination and harassment based on age, color, gender
(including relationship violence and sexual misconduct), gender
identity, disability status, height, marital status, national origin,
political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran
status, and weight.

Individuals can report incidents of harassment and discrimination to the
[Office of Institutional
Equity](https://oie.msu.edu/index.html "OIE website") (OIE) by
completing the online [Public Incident Reporting
Form](https://oie-msu-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/index.php/pid566343 "Public Reporting Form")
or by calling OIE at 517-353-3922 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. - 12:00
p.m. and 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

The expanded Misconduct Hotline does not replace the University
Reporting Protocols regarding child abuse, sexual assault or child
pornography or the mandatory reporting requirements regarding
relationship violence and sexual misconduct. While such issues may be
referred to the Misconduct Hotline, employees are also required to
follow the appropriate reporting protocols. The child abuse reporting
protocols are available at the [Human Resources
website](/policies-procedures/university-wide/reporting_protocols.html "HR website")
and the mandatory reporting protocols for incidents of relationship
violence and sexual misconduct are detailed in the [Relationship
Violence and Sexual Misconduct
Policy](/policies-procedures/university-wide/RVSM_policy.html "RVSM Policy").

The University prohibits retaliation against any individual who makes a
report in good faith of known or suspected misconduct. All employees
should report any known or suspected misconduct immediately.
