**Questionnaires**

To ensure consistency and accuracy in the reporting of data to external
agencies and to other colleges and universities, all questionnaires
requiring data for the entire University should be coordinated with the
Office of Planning and Budgets at 517-355-9271. This office will
consider whether the data requested is readily available and whether the
information should be released to the inquiring agent. Data requests or
questionnaires relating primarily to a unit, but that also require
all-university data, should be cleared with the Office of Planning and
Budgets. If this office does not possess the necessary data, referral to
the appropriate office or person will be made. For more information,
visit the [Office of Planning and
Budgets](http://www.opb.msu.edu "Office of Planning and Budgets") website.
