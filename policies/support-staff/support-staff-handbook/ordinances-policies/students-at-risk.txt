**Students at Risk**

Employees may occasionally come into contact with students who are
disruptive, potentially dangerous or experiencing a crisis related to
campus or academic life. The Student Risk and Review Committee (SRRC)
was established by the Vice President for Students Affairs and Services
to help coordinate the response of multiple campus offices across campus
to such students. The goal of the SRRC is to help the student resolve
issues and to promote a safe and productive environment for the
University community. Employees who have concerns about a particular
student should submit their concern to the SRRC. SRRC inquiries can be
made by telephone (517-355-8270), fax (517-353-3398), or email (
<SRRC@cc.msu.edu> ).  [Additional information about the
SRRC](http://www.counseling.msu.edu/feature/student-risk-and-review-committee "Student Risk and Review Committee")
, as well as the Student Risk and Review Quick Reference Guide, can be
found online.
