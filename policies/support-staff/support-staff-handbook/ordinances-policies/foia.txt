**Freedom of Information Act**

The Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulates and sets
requirements for the disclosure of public records by all public bodies
in the State of Michigan. As a public institution in the State, the
University is subject to provisions of the FOIA. Under the FOIA, all
persons, except those incarcerated, have the right to inspect and/or
receive copies of public records maintained by the University. A request
must be made in writing, which includes e-mail or fax. The MSU FOIA
Office is responsible for handling all FOIA requests made to the
University. Any office or employee at the University who receives a FOIA
request must promptly forward the request to the MSU FOIA Office by fax
at 517-353-1794, e-mail to <foia@msu.edu>, or mail to 117 Olds Hall.
Individuals should be encouraged to submit their requests directly to
the MSU FOIA Office to avoid inadvertent delays. For additional
information on the FOIA, contact the MSU FOIA Office at 517-353-3929.
