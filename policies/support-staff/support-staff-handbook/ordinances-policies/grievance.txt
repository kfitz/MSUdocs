**Grievance Procedure for Non-Bargained for Employees**

Non-Union staff members have the right to present concerns related to
the application of employment policies. If a solution to the problem
cannot be worked out between the employee and the immediate supervisor,
a grievance procedure is available. A copy of the grievance procedure
and forms may be obtained from the appropriate union, association, or
Employee Relations at 517-353-5510. View [additional
information regarding the grievance
procedure](https://www.hr.msu.edu/grievances/support-staff/procedures.html "Grievance Procedure for Non-Union Staff").
