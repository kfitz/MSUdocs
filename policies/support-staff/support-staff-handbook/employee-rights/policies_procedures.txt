**Human Resource Policies and Procedures**

The Human Resources website contains official University policy
statements pertaining to terms and conditions of employment. Policies,
definitions, descriptions, limitations, procedures, and the
responsibilities of the employee, supervisor, and employing department
are specifically stated. While attempts have been made to accurately
account for variations in policies and procedures for various employee
groups, conflicts that arise must be resolved in favor of the language
in the Collective Bargaining Agreements or master insurance contracts.
