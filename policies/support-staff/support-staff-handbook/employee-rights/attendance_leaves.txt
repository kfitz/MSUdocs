**Attendance/Leaves**

**Absences**

Employees are expected to maintain good attendance. When absent from
work due to unavoidable circumstances, an employee must make a good
faith effort to immediately notify his/her supervisor of the reason. If
the absence is to continue beyond the first day, the employee must
notify his/her supervisor on a daily basis unless otherwise arranged.
Absence for three consecutive workdays without notifying the supervisor
is considered a voluntary termination.

All absences must be charged to personal leave, accrued vacation, or
sick leave, whichever is appropriate. When no accrued time is available,
unpaid leave of up to 10 days per fiscal year may be approved by the
supervisor. The lost wages will be reflected in the employee's paycheck.
Absences exceeding 10 consecutive days must be approved as a leave of
absence by Human Resources.

Absences due to inclement weather or declared state of emergency will
require the use of either personal leave or vacation time.

entitled to vacation time with pay after the completion of six months of
service.

  ------------------------ ---------------------- ------------------- ----------------------------

\*May vary within collective bargaining units and for certain employee
classification levels. Half-time and three-quarter-time employees accrue
vacation on a proportional basis.

Employees are expected to use their annual vacation accrual each year.
When this is not feasible, employees may make special arrangements with
their department administrator to accrue additional time, but the
accrual cannot exceed the special maximum accrual amount. Special
maximum accrual amounts may vary within collective bargaining units.

There will be no vacation accrual in the following situations:

-   During a leave of absence without pay

    accruals will be credited upon return from leave
-   Beyond the special maximum accrual
-   While on layoff
-   While on disciplinary suspension
-   While on Extended Disability Leave

**Usage**:

-   Vacation should be taken at a time agreeable to both the employee
    and the department administrator and must be approved by the
    department administrator prior to usage.
-   Employees will receive their current base rate of pay during
    vacation.
-   Additional pay cannot be received by an employee in lieu of using
    vacation time.
-   University holidays falling within the employee's vacation will not
    be charged to the employee's accrued vacation.
-   Employees will receive payment for unused vacation accruals at the
    time of their termination/ retirement.

**Sick Leave with Pay**

**Eligibility**: Regular employees who work half time or more are
eligible to accrue sick leave.

**Accrual**: Full-time employees accrue sick leave at the rate of four
hours for each two weeks of service. Half-time and three-quarter-time
employees accrue sick leave on a proportional basis. Sick leave credits
may be accumulated as indicated by policy and applicable collective
bargaining agreements.

Personal leave must be approved by the supervisor and used in increments
of one tenth of one hour. No time may be carried forward into the next
fiscal year. However, if the employee requests use of personal leave
before June 1 and the request cannot be approved due to operational

employees while on active status, such as vacation, sick leave, and
longevity pay, do not accrue during leave without pay. Employees should

**Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**

Staff employed at the University for a total of 12 months (may have been
intermittent employment) and having at least 1,250 work hours during the
12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of FMLA leave.
The Department of Labor (DOL) has revised this regulation to provide
that a service break of seven years or more need not be counted in
determining whether an employee has been employed for at least 12
months.

The 1,250 hours requirement is counted only for hours actually worked
and does not count hours spent on vacation, sick, and personal leave,
etc. However, under the federal Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), employees called to active (or
National Guard) duty are entitled, upon their return to employment, to
all the benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they had
been continuously employed.

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a federal law enacted
to help employees balance their work and family life and to promote the
stability and economic security of families. It allows eligible
employees to take job-protected unpaid leave, or substitute appropriate
paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total
of 12 workweeks during a 12- month period (July 1 - June 30) for a
family or personal serious health condition which qualifies under FMLA.

The FMLA also provides leave for service members and their families
under certain circumstances.

On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed into law the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (H.R. 2647). In section 565, the
legislation makes important changes to the Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA).

Specifically, military caregiver leave has been expanded so it may be
used to care for veterans undergoing treatment, recuperation or therapy
for an injury, as long as the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces,
National Guard or Reserves within five years of requiring care. The
amendments also expand military caregiver leave so that employees may
use it to care for a covered service member\'s serious injury or illness
incurred because service on active duty aggravated an existing or
preexisting injuries. Previously, the act only allowed caregiver leave
for serious illnesses or injuries incurred on active duty.

The legislation also expands the use of qualifying exigency leave. Under
the new law, qualifying exigency leave will now cover family members of
the regular Armed Forces deployed to a foreign country, in addition to
current coverage of family members of the Guard or Reserves.

**Bereavement Days**

**Eligibility**: Regular employees working half time or more will be
excused with pay to attend the funeral and/or make necessary
arrangements when a death occurs in the employee's immediate family.

**Time Allowed**: Up to three (3) days in the case of death of spouse or
Other Eligible Individual, child or Other Eligible Individual's child,
parent, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law,
brother-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, grandparent,
grandparent-in-law, grandchild, stepparent, half-sister, half-brother,
or relative as specified in the [MSU Policy and
Procedure](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/bereavement.html "Bereavement") or [Collective
Bargaining
Agreements](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html "Union Contracts").

One (1) day in the case of the death of an uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece

**Other**: Funeral leave may be taken during the period including the
day of death and the day following the funeral, but shall not exceed
three days. Further time required may be granted in accordance with
other leave policies.

A reasonable number of employees with supervisory permission may attend
the funeral or serve as pallbearers for a deceased employee without loss
of pay.

**Jury Duty**

The University recognizes the civic responsibility of employees to serve
on jury duty and makes provision for staff members to perform such duty
without loss of pay. The University will compensate the employee called
to jury duty, or as a subpoenaed witness, based on straight time base
pay for up to 80 consecutive hours. After 80 hours, the employee will
receive the difference between base pay and jury pay. The employee's
benefits will continue. The employee must notify his/her supervisor of
the call to jury duty as soon as it is received and must provide proof
of jury duty attendance. The employee is expected to report for regular
University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at court.
