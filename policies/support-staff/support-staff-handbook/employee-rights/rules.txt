**Rules Governing Personal Conduct of Employees**

The Rules of Personal Conduct for Employees are intended to promote the
orderly and efficient operation of Michigan State University, as well as
to protect the rights of all employees. Violations, therefore, shall be
regarded as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge. Discharge may result from an accumulation of minor
infractions, or for a single serious infraction. Disciplinary action
under these rules does not preclude an employee from discipline for
violation of University policies or ordinances, criminal liability or
sanctions for violation of local, state or federal laws. These rules do
not preclude any University department from establishing additional
rules for its employees that are necessary for the effective operation
of that department. This is not a comprehensive list of rules, and the
University reserves the right to discipline employees for acts or
omissions not stated below. 

Each employee is required to conduct himself/herself in a professional
manner at all times. The following are examples of prohibited conduct:

1\. Sexual Harassment:

Sexual harassment is a form of unlawful gender (sex) discrimination and
is not tolerated at Michigan State University. All employees should be
familiar with the [University Policy on Relationship Violence & Sexual
Misconduct ](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/RVSM_policy.html "University Policy on Relationship Violence & Sexual Misconduct")available
online.

2\. Sexual Conduct: Behavior of a sexual nature that is not sexual
harassment may, nonetheless, be unprofessional in the workplace,
disruptive in the classroom or violate other University policies; and,
like other behavior that is unprofessional, disruptive, or violates a
University policy or ordinance, it could warrant discipline.

Many types of behavior may constitute sexual harassment or sexual
conduct including, but not limited to, the following:

-   Sexual assault
-   Threats or insinuations that lead the affected individual reasonably
    to believe that granting or denying sexual favors will affect
    his/her reputation, education, employment, advancement, or standing
    within the University
-   Sexual advances, sexual propositions, or sexual demands that are not
    agreeable to both parties
-   Unwelcome and persistent sexually explicit statements or stories
    that are not related to employment
-   Sexually explicit e-mails or text messages
-   Sexual misconduct such as stalking, cyber stalking, voyeurism, or
    recording or transmitting sexual images
-   Repeated use of sexually degrading language or sounds to describe a
    person
-   Unwanted and unnecessary touching, patting, hugging, or other
    physical contact
-   Comments or questions about an individual\'s sexual prowess, sexual
    deficiencies, or sexual behavior
-   Dissemination of sexually explicit materials through the
    University\'s information technology resources
-   Creation, dissemination, or display of offensive items or materials
    that disrupt the work environment including, but not limited to,
    photographs, graphics, symbols or video or audio recordings

 3. Other Prohibited Harassment or Inappropriate Conduct :

Other Unlawful Harassment may occur when a University community member
is subject to unwelcome conduct based on a category protected in the
Anti-Discrimination Policy.  These categories include: age, color,
gender, gender identity, genetic information, disability status, height,
marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion,
sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight. Unwelcome conduct that is
objectively and subjectively severe, persistent or pervasive and creates
an unreasonable interference with the individual\'s work or education
experience is considered harassment. For more details, see
the [Anti-Discrimination Policy.\
](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/ADP_policy.html "Anti-Discrimination Policy")

Behavior that is based on a protected category, but does not rise to the
level of prohibited harassment under the ADP, may nonetheless be
unprofessional in the workplace, disruptive in the classroom, or violate
other University policies and, like other behavior that is
unprofessional, disruptive, or violates a University policy or
ordinance, could warrant discipline.
