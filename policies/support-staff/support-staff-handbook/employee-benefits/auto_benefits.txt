Michigan resident undergraduate credit course tuition at Michigan State
University. The student must be admitted to a regular degree- granting
program. [Click here for more information regarding Course Fee

**Educational Assistance**

**Eligibility**: Regular full-time (90-100 percent) and part-time (50%
or more) employees who meet program provisions as provided in collective
bargaining agreements may take advantage of this benefit. General
eligibility criteria include the required number of full-time equivalent
(FTE) service months, and admission into a degree program or job-related
course. Whether release time is given during working hours is dependent
upon specific collective bargaining agreements and approval by the
department administrator/supervisor. This benefit also covers non-credit
courses.

**Coverage**: The amount of tuition waiver or reimbursement for courses
will be based on a percentage of the MSU regular prevailing tuition rate
per credit. The number of eligible courses and credit hours may differ
by employee group in accordance with the applicable collective
bargaining agreements. Reimbursement for noncredit courses is also
available.

Tuition waiver for a percentage of MSU credit courses is available to
most employee groups as provided by the separate collective bargaining
agreements.

A grade of 2.0 or higher is required for credit courses to be covered by
the benefit. The employee must provide evidence that he/she has
successfully completed a course. When MSU tuition waiver has been
requested, the employee will authorize release of record of MSU course
work, grades, and specific tuition awards to the Human Resource
Development office on the tuition benefit application.

Employees eligible for other financial aid will be covered only for that
portion of the tuition fee that exceeds the amount of those benefits.
