**Effect of Leave/Termination/Death on Benefits**

**With Pay:** During a leave of absence with pay or approved Family
Medical Leave Act leave, employee contributions for optional benefit
programs will continue to be deducted and the University will continue
its regular contributions toward health plan coverage and the Base
Retirement Program. Dental and Long-Term Disability coverage remains in
force for those enrolled and eligible immediately prior to the leave.

**Without Pay:** Employees granted approved leave of absence without
pay:

-   May continue the health, dental, Optional Employee-Paid Life, and
    Accidental Death & Dismemberment programs by paying the full cost of
    the applicable premium. If coverages are not maintained, the
    employee may re-enroll within 31 days of returning to active
    employment or during the annual open enrollment.
-   Individuals enrolled in the health plan waiver receive a prorated
    payment in July based on the number of months worked during the
    fiscal year (July 1-June 30).
-   Employee contributions to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) are
    suspended during the leave and may restart upon return from leave.
    FSA claims incurred during the leave may be submitted upon return
    from leave.
-   Basic Employer Paid Life insurance coverage remains in force up to
    180 days from the last day of pay by the University.

Employees will receive a communication from MSU Human Resources
outlining benefit options for the employee on a leave of absence without
pay.

**Effect of Termination on Benefits**

In case of termination, benefit programs will be affected as follows:

-   Optional Employee-Paid Life, and Accidental Death & Dismemberment
    coverages will continue in force until the end of the month
    following the month in which the last deduction and/or contribution
    is made toward these plans.
-   In accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
    Act (COBRA) if employment terminates, the employee is laid off, or
    the appointment is reduced to less than 50 percent, the employee may
    elect to continue health care and/or dental coverage for the
    employee, the employee\'s spouse, and/or dependent children for up
    to 18 months (29 months if disabled and receiving social security
    disability) by paying the premium and an administrative charge.
-   Health care and dental coverage terminate at the end of the month
    employment terminates.
-   Long-Term Disability, Basic Employer Paid Life, and Travel Accident
    insurance coverages cease on the last day of active employment.
-   Optional Employee-Paid Life and Basic Employer Paid Life insurance
    coverages may be converted to an individual life insurance policy by
    contacting the carrier within 31 days of benefit termination.

Employees will receive a communication from MSU Human Resources
outlining benefit options for the terminated employee.

**Death**

In the event of an employee\'s death, the following benefits may be
available to designated beneficiaries:

-   Optional Employee-Paid Life Insurance
-   Basic Employer Paid Life Insurance
-   Base and/or Supplemental Retirement death benefits
-   Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance
-   Travel Accident Insurance

Under COBRA, the spouse and/or dependent children of an active employee

coverage for up to 36 months by paying the premium and an administrative
charge. For more information regarding coverage continuation, click
