Faculty Policies and Procedures

**Faculty and Academic Staff Overtime and Time Tracking Policy and
Procedure**

Policy {#policy xmlns=""}
------

**Applies to all Faculty and Academic Staff classified as non-exempt
under the [Fair Labor Standards
Act](/flsa/index.html "Fair Labor Standards Act") (FLSA).**

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a federal act that requires
payment of overtime and the minimum wage for all employees considered
"non-exempt" under the Act. In addition to the overtime requirement, the
law requires the tracking of time of those employees who are non-exempt.
There is no such requirement for exempt employees.

**Overtime: **Overtime is defined under the FLSA as hours worked in
excess of 40 during a single workweek. Paid leave time is not considered
time worked and cannot be counted toward the 40 hour per workweek
overtime calculation.

At MSU, overtime must be approved in advance by the employee's
supervisor. Employees working overtime without prior approval are
subject to discipline up to and including discharge. 

**Compensable time: **A non-exempt employee is entitled to compensation
for all hours worked. If a supervisor allows an employee to work, or has
reason to believe an employee has worked certain hours, the University
is responsible for compensating the employee for those hours. A
nonexempt employee cannot waive the right to compensation for hours
worked.

**Compensatory time off: **A non-exempt employee may be paid
compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. This must be paid at a
time-and-a-half rate as well (e.g., an employee who works 5 hours of
overtime is entitled to 7.5 hours of compensatory time). Compensatory
time must be mutually arranged between the employee(s) and the
supervisor (see [Faculty and Academic Staff Compensatory Time Policy &
Procedure](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/fas-policies-procedures/comp_time.html "Faculty and Academic Staff Compensatory Time Policy & Procedure") for
details). Supervisors must track compensatory time earned and taken in
the HR/Payroll System through the EBS portal.

**Flexible time: **At the supervisor's discretion, an employee's work
schedule may be adjusted or flexed **within** a workweek. However, this
does not abdicate the requirement to pay overtime for all hours worked
over 40.

**Part-time: **Part-time, non-exempt employees will report all time
worked, just as full-time employees will. They will earn overtime only
after 40 hours worked in a week. They will receive straight time pay or
compensatory time for all time worked under 40 hours in a week, even if
hours worked are in addition to the employee's normal schedule.

Procedure {#procedure xmlns=""}
---------

**Time tracking procedures: **All Faculty and Academic Staff classified
as non-exempt must accurately track and record their hours worked each
day, as well as leave taken, using this [time
sheet](/flsa/documents/Time_Tracking_Record.xlsx "Time Tracking Record").
Time will be tracked to the nearest tenth of an hour. Supervisors must
review and verify non-exempt employees' time, entered on their time
sheets, weekly. 

**Procedure for time reporting in EBS: **Supervisors or unit time
administrators must also report all absences and additional hours worked
beyond their scheduled work hours into the HR/Payroll System through the
EBS portal by the time due for payroll processing. 

**Supervisor Responsibilities:**

1.  Be familiar with the University's policies which govern overtime,
    hours worked and time reporting. Information and resources you will
    need are contained
    at [www.hr.msu.edu/flsa](/flsa/index.html "FLSA webpage"). 
2.  Remind employees that they are responsible for knowing the time
    tracking procedures contained in this policy and the importance of
    adhering to all policies and procedures.
3.  Ensure employees have the [MSU approved
    timesheet](/flsa/documents/Time_Tracking_Record.xlsx "MSU approved timesheet").
4.  Review and verify time weekly. Correct any erroneous or missed
    entries on a timely basis. 
5.  If you discover that overtime was reported, but not preapproved, you
    should address it as a policy violation which may mean discipline.
    However, you must still pay the time as time worked, regardless of
    whether preapproval was granted.
6.  If you know, **or have reason to believe**, that an employee worked
    more than the hours they reported, you should address it as a policy
    violation which may mean discipline. However, you must still pay the
    time as time worked, regardless of what they reported. 
7.  Determine if overtime is needed and schedule employee(s)
    accordingly.
8.  Provide as much advance notice to the employee(s) as is practicable.
9.  Maintain records of time sheets and other records created per this
    policy for three years.

**Employee Responsibilities:**

1.  Ensure that your time is tracked properly and that your time is
    recorded completely and accurately on a weekly basis. **If you work
    more than you record, you are in violation of this policy.** If you
    believe you are being coerced, persuaded or otherwise encouraged to
    record inaccurate hours, you should report this to Academic Human
    Resources immediately (contact information below). If you would
    rather do so anonymously, you may report this to the MSU misconduct
    hotline
    at[ http://misconduct.msu.edu/](/documents/facacadpolproc/%20http:/misconduct.msu.edu/ "MSU Misconduct Hotline"). 
2.  Adhere to all University policies, procedures and departmental rules
    related to time and attendance.
3.  Report promptly any discrepancies or inaccuracies in time worked,
    compensatory or overtime earned and in pay to your supervisor or
    Academic Human Resources (contact information below).

**Supervisor/Unit Time Administrator Responsibilities:** Enter
exceptions in the HR/Payroll system through the EBS portal by the time
due for payroll processing.  If an employee worked overtime, entering
the hours will trigger the overtime payment in the next paycheck.
