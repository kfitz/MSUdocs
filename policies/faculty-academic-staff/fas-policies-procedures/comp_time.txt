Faculty Policies and Procedures

**Faculty and Academic Staff Compensatory Time Policy and Procedure**

**Applies to all Faculty and Academic Staff classified as non-exempt
under the [Fair Labor Standards
Act](/flsa/index.html "Fair Labor Standards Act") (FLSA).**

**Policy** {#policy xmlns=""}
----------

Supervisors may provide compensatory time at a time-and-one-half rate
for every hour worked over 40 hours in a work week in lieu of
time-and-one-half overtime pay for non-exempt employees under the FLSA
in certain circumstances. The [Faculty and Academic Staff (FAS) Overtime
Policy &
Procedure](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/fas-policies-procedures/overtime.html "Faculty and Academic Staff (FAS) Overtime Policy & Procedure") governs
the payment of overtime to all non-exempt FAS employees. This policy and
procedure governs situations in which compensatory time is substituted
for overtime.  Under the FLSA, this can be done only if certain
conditions, which are set forth in this policy, are met. 

**Compensatory time agreement: **Each time any compensatory time is to
be earned, before it is earned, the supervisor and employee must
mutually agree to the compensatory time arrangement, in writing, by
completing [this
agreement](/flsa/documents/Agreement-to-Accept-Compensatory-Time-in-Lieu-of-Overtime-Payment.pdf "Agreement to Accept Compensatory Time in Lieu of Overtime Payment").

**Cap on time: **An employee cannot accrue more than 240 hours of
compensatory time; thus, any hours worked over 160 hours (which amounts
to 240 hours of compensatory time, earned at a time-and-a-half rate)
must be paid. 

**Combination time: **A combination of overtime and compensatory time
may be used. If an employee works, for example, 44 hours in a workweek,
it is permissible for two of the hours to be earned as time-and-a-half
overtime and two of the hours to be earned as time-and-a-half
compensatory time. 

**Using earned compensatory time: **An employee must request to take any
earned compensatory time by giving his/her supervisor sufficient notice
and the request should be granted by the supervisor as long as there is
no undue disruption to the work.

**Flexible time -- distinction: **Compensatory time is different than
"flex time." For non-exempt employees, flex time may be used only to
flex their time **within **a workweek. Flexible weeks are permissible
under the FLSA as long as any hours over 40 are paid at
time-and-a-half. 

Procedure {#procedure xmlns=""}
---------

**Reporting of compensatory time: **Department: For the employees
described in the above Policy, earned compensatory time must be reported
in the HR/Payroll System through the EBS portal. Used compensatory time
must be reported in this system as well. To record compensatory time
earned, departments should enter only the number of hours worked at
straight time. The FLSA allows non-exempt employees to accrue a maximum
of 240 hours of compensatory time (which reflects 160 overtime hours
worked).

**Payout procedure: **Compensatory time must be paid out upon transfer
to a new department/unit by the previous department and upon
termination.  Compensatory time must be paid out upon termination at the
higher of the two pay rates: current rate or average regular rate over
the previous three years.

When an employee transfers to a new unit or terminates, any remaining
compensatory time should be paid by submitting the [Special Payments
Authorization
form](http://www.ctlr.msu.edu/Download.aspx?id=Payroll "Special Payments Authorization form") to
Payroll. 

**Supervisor Responsibilities:**

1.  Be familiar with the University's policies which govern overtime,
    compensatory time, hours worked and payroll reporting. Information
    and resources you will need are contained
    at [www.hr.msu.edu/flsa](/flsa/index.html "FLSA webpage"). 
2.  Remind employees that they are responsible for knowing this policy
    and remind them of the importance of adhering to all policies and
    procedures.
3.  Obtain consent from the employee for substituting compensatory time
    for overtime prior to the time the work is performed. [This
    form](/flsa/documents/Agreement-to-Accept-Compensatory-Time-in-Lieu-of-Overtime-Payment.pdf "Agreement to Accept Compensatory Time in Lieu of Overtime Payment") needs
    to be completed to document this agreement between the supervisor
    and employee each time the agreement is made.  ** **
4.  Track, review and approve compensatory time earned and used on the
    employee's timesheet. Correct any erroneous or missed entries on a
    timely basis. 
5.  Enter and approve compensatory time when earned and used in the
    HR/Payroll System through the EBS portal (unless your unit time
    administrator handles this instead).
6.  Maintain records of time sheets and other records created per this
    policy for three years.
7.  Ensure compensatory time is paid out upon transfer to a new unit and
    upon termination.
8.  Because there is a cap on compensatory time, once employees reach
    that cap, they must be paid overtime for each additional hour worked
    over the cap.

**Employee Responsibilities:**

1.  Be sure to seek preapproval if you would like to earn compensatory
    time instead of overtime by completing [this
    form](/flsa/documents/Agreement-to-Accept-Compensatory-Time-in-Lieu-of-Overtime-Payment.pdf "Agreement to Accept Compensatory Time in Lieu of Overtime Payment") and
    indicating your consent on your time sheet. If approved by your
    supervisor, they will provide notice to you about the status of the
    amount of your compensatory time accumulation upon request.
2.  Adhere to all University policies, procedures and departmental rules
    related to time and attendance.
3.  Report promptly any discrepancies or inaccuracies in compensatory
    time earned or used to your supervisor or Academic Human Resources
    (contact information below).

**Unit Time Administrator Responsibilities:** Obtain the information
from the supervisor to enter and/or approve compensatory time in the
HR/Payroll System through the EBS portal when earned and used, if the
supervisor does not. Complete [Special Payment Authorization
form](http://www.ctlr.msu.edu/Download.aspx?id=Payroll "Special Payment Authorization form")when
payout of compensatory time is required and submit to Payroll. 

**MSU Human Resources Employee Records:** Review the [Special Payment
Authorization
form](http://www.ctlr.msu.edu/Download.aspx?id=Payroll "Special Payment Authorization form") for
compliance with the policy and accuracy. After approval, the form is
sent to the Payroll Office.

**Payroll Office:** Issue compensatory time payout check at the
appropriate biweekly or monthly pay period.
