**[]{#q1}Q1. I am pregnant.  Am I eligible for paid leave under [MSU
leave
policy?](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/leave_policies.html "Medical Leaves")**

::: {xmlns=""}
> Pregnant faculty and academic staff appointed nine months or more at
> 50% time or more are immediately eligible for Short-Term Disability
> leave upon hire.

**[]{#q2}Q2. I am pregnant and eligible for paid leave under MSU leave
policy. How much paid leave will I have?**

> The [Short-Term Disability
> policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/leave_policies.html "Medical Leaves") provides
> paid leave for disability related to pregnancy, childbirth and/or
> recovery for six (6) weeks beginning with the projected delivery date,
> based on medical certification indicating the projected delivery date.
> Six weeks is the normal period, however if health problems prevent the
> birth-mother from working for a longer period of time, the Short-Term
> Disability policy provides paid leave up to six (6) months, based on
> medical certification specifying the dates of the period of
> disability. The period of Short-Term Disability is based on calendar
> days. However, for academic year (AY) faculty/academic staff the
> non-duty days (May 16 through August 15) are excluded from calculating
> the six (6) month limit for Short-Term Disability.

> [Parental
> leave](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/parental_leave.html "Parental Leave") (which
> is separate from Short-Term Disability leave) provides six weeks of
> paid leave in addition to Short-Term Disability leave for
> birth-mothers. Parental leave is based on calendar days, except that
> upon the request of an academic year (AY) faculty/academic staff
> member, the parental leave clock will be stopped during non-duty days.
> (Non-duty days run from May 16 through August 15 for AY appointments).
> Birth-mothers can take parental leave entirely before, entirely after,
> or split around the Short-Term Disability leave. Parental leave must
> be taken within one year of the birth.
:::

**[]{#q3}Q3. I am pregnant and eligible for paid leave under MSU leave
policy. How do I apply for leave?**

1.  Inform the unit administrator (e.g., department chairperson, school
    director, etc.) that you are requesting Short-Term Disability and
    Parental leave.
2.  You are encouraged to discuss the scheduling of Parental leave with
    the unit administrator with regard to the needs of the
    department/unit.
3.  If  both you and the newborn\'s other parent are employed by the
    same department or school, you should plan the timing of your leaves
    in consultation with the unit administrator. 
4.  Obtain medical certification stating the projected delivery date; 
    or obtain medical certification specifying the dates you are unable
    to work.
5.  Give the medical certification of projected delivery date or of
    dates of disability to the person who handles academic personnel
    actions for your unit, along with the begin date you wish to leave
    work.

**[]{#q4}Q4. I am a father, or other non-birthing parent, but not an
adoptive parent. Am I eligible for paid leave under MSU leave policy?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> A faculty/academic staff member appointed nine months or more at 50%
> time or more who is a father, or other non-birthing parent, but not an
> adoptive parent is immediately eligible for Parental leave upon hire.
> (Adoptive parents, see Question 5 below.)
:::

**[]{#q5}Q5. I am an adoptive parent. Am I eligible for paid leave under
MSU leave policy?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> A faculty/academic staff member appointed nine months or more at 50%
> time or more who is adopting a child younger than age six and/or not
> attending school full-time is eligible for Parental leave.
:::

**[]{#q6}Q6. I am a father, adoptive parent, or other non-birthing
parent, and I am eligible for Parental leave under MSU
leave** **policy.  How much paid leave will I have?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> Parental leave provides six weeks of paid leave. The leave must be
> taken within one year of the birth or adoption.  Parental leave is
> based on calendar days, except that upon the request of an academic
> year (AY) faculty/academic staff member, the parental leave clock will
> be stopped during non-duty days. (Non-duty days run from May 16
> through August 15 for AY appointments).
:::

**[]{#q7}Q7. I am a father, adoptive parent, or other non-birthing
parent, and I am eligible for Parental leave under MSU leave policy. 
How do I apply for leave?**

1.  Inform the unit administrator (e.g., department chairperson, school
    director, etc.) that you are requesting Parental leave.
2.  You are encouraged to discuss the scheduling of Parental leave with
    the unit administrator with regard to the needs of the
    department/unit. If both you and the child\'s other parent are
    employed by the same department or school, you should plan the
    timing of your leaves in consultation with the unit administrator.  
3.  Obtain medical certification of projected delivery date, evidence of
    birth;  or in the case of adoption, evidence of adoption, plus the
    age of child or evidence that the child is not attending school
    full-time.
4.  Give the medical certification of delivery date, evidence of birth;
    or in the case of adoption, evidence of adoption plus age of child
    or school attendance, to the person who handles academic personnel
    actions for your unit, along with the begin date you wish to leave
    work and the length of leave.

**Q8. Can I take Parental leave on an intermittent basis?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> Requests for **intermittent Parental leave** must be **mutually agreed
> upon by both you and your unit administrator**. Your leave is
> intermittent if you work a reduced schedule, or the periods of your
> leave are discontinuous. Splitting your parental leave around your
> Short-Term Disability leave but contiguous with it (i.e., part of your
> parental leave is taken immediately before the Short-Term Disability
> and part taken immediately after your Short-Term Disability) does not
> constitute an intermittent leave. Stopping your Parental leave clock
> during non-duty days does not constitute an intermittent leave.
:::

**[]{#q9}Q9. I am in the tenure system \[continuing appointment system\]
but have not yet been granted tenure \[continuing appointment\]. Can I
extend my probationary appointment  (i.e., put off my next review for
reappointment and/or tenure \[continuing\] for one year) due to the
birth or adoption of a child?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> The probationary appointment is extended automatically **upon
> request** from a faculty/academic staff member for the birth or
> adoption of a child.  Faculty can request an extension of the next
> reappointment/promotion/tenure review for the birth or adoption of a
> child. Extensions for this reason are limited to two separate one-year
> extensions during the entire probationary period. The request for an
> automatic one-year extension for the birth or adoption of a child must
> be submitted within two years of the birth/adoption, but no later than
> the due date for the submission to the department/school of the
> dossier for the next reappointment/promotion/tenure review. Any
> additional requests must be endorsed by your unit administrator, and
> approved by the University Committee on Faculty Tenure (for tenure
> system faculty) or the Provost (for academic specialists, librarians,
> MSU extension, and FRIB/NSCL academic staff).
:::

**[]{#q10}Q10. Is my FMLA ([Family and Medical Leave
Act](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/family_medical_leave.html "Family Leave"))
entitlement affected by my paid Short-Term Disability and/or Parental
leave?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> Yes. Your FMLA entitlement for a fiscal year (July 1 of one year to
> June 30 of the following year) will be reduced by the time taken as
> Short-Term Disability and/or Parental leave during that fiscal year.
:::

**[]{#q11}Q11. Is the length of my Short-Term Disability leave and/or
Parental leave dependent in any way on the length of my FMLA (Family
Medical Leave Act) entitlement?**

::: {xmlns=""}
> No. The length of Short-Term Disability leave and/or Parental leave is
> not affected in any way by the amount of your FMLA entitlement
> remaining at the time your Short-Term Disability and/or Parental leave
> begins.

\
**[]{#q12}Q12. Can I get more time off from work due to the birth or
adoption of a child than is provided by the Short-Term Disability and/or
Parental leave?**

> You may use any remaining FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act)  entitlement
> that you have, as an FMLA leave without pay. In addition, if your unit
> administrator (e.g., department chairperson, school director, etc.)
> agrees to it, you may arrange to use vacation time if you have any, or
> arrange a leave [without
> pay](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/LOA_WithoutPay.html "Leave of Absence without pay") for
> child care.
:::
