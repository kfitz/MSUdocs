staff and executive managers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#General}General Requirements {#general-requirements xmlns=""}
--------------------------------

**Who is required to undergo a criminal background check?** \
All paid and unpaid faculty, academic staff, and executive management
appointments, including visiting and on-call appointments, for which an
offer of employment is made on or after February 1, 2010 are required to
undergo a criminal background check. This does not apply to individuals
to be appointed as postdoctoral fellows.

**Do foreign nationals need to undergo a criminal background check?** \
Foreign nationals who come to the University** directly from residence
outside of the US** are not required to undergo a criminal background
check as they have obtained necessary background clearances through the
Department of Homeland Security. However, degree verification is still
required.

In the case where a foreign national has not come directly to the
University from residence  outside of the US, the individual is required
to undergo a background check, permitted the individual has been in the
US for 6 months or longer.

**How do I initiate degree verification for foreign nationals in
HireRight?** \
After you login to HireRight and select whether you or the applicant
will complete the forms, you will then select the "Education Only -
Foreign Nationals Pkg" package instead of the "Standard" package. The
"Foreign Nationals" package contains degree verification only.

**Are individuals to be appointed at the rank of postdoctoral fellow
required to undergo a criminal background check?** \
No. Individuals to be appointed at the rank of postdoctoral fellow are
not required to undergo a criminal background check. These individuals
are not considered employees of the university.

**Are individuals changing from an on-call appointment to a fixed term
or continuing system appointment required to undergo a criminal
background check?** \
Yes. Individuals who have never had a criminal background check before
and are changing their appointment status from an on-call to a fixed
term or continuing system appointment are required to undergo a criminal
background check.

**My unit hires academic staff members for one semester only every year
(e.g., every fall). Are these individuals required to undergo a criminal
background check if they already underwent one last year?** \
Yes. Individuals who incur a break in employment of 6 months or greater
are required to undergo a criminal background check.

If the degree on record has previously been verified, you will want to
select the package called \"Standard without Education.\" Since it was
previously verified, it does not need to be re-verified. However, if the
employee has since received a new degree, please use the "Standard"
package and ask the employee to include the new degree to be verified.

**My unit has rehired a faculty/academic staff member who retired from
the university. Are these individuals required to undergo a criminal
background check? **\
Individuals who incur a break in service of 6 months or less are not
required to undergo a background check. However, individuals who incur a
break in employment of 6 months or greater are required to undergo a
criminal background check.

**My unit is hiring graduate assistants for summer academic
appointments. Are these individuals required to undergo a criminal
background check?** \
If the appointment is one where the individual will hold an academic
rank, these individuals are required to undergo a criminal background
check.

**Are individuals changing from a fixed term position to a continuing
system position required to undergo a criminal background check?** \
Yes. Individuals who have never had a criminal background check before
and are changing their appointment status from a fixed term appointment
to a new continuing system appointment are required to undergo a
criminal background check.

**Are individuals changing from a support staff position to faculty,
academic staff, or executive management position required to undergo a
criminal background check?** \
It depends. A criminal background check is required if the individual
has never undergone a criminal background check at MSU or if the
individual has incurred a break in service of six months or greater. A
criminal background check is not required if the individual has
undergone a criminal background check and has not incurred a break in
service of six months or greater. However, degree verification is still
required. In this case, please select the "Education Only - Foreign
Nationals Pkg" package instead of the "Standard" package.

[]{#Access}HireRight Access and Training {#hireright-access-and-training xmlns=""}
----------------------------------------

**Who initiates the criminal background checks for faculty and academic
staff?** \
Criminal background checks for faculty and academic staff will be
initiated at the academic unit level.

**Where do I need to go to initiate criminal background checks?** \
Michigan State University has contracted with HireRight, an outside
vendor, to perform the criminal background checks. The login for
HireRight is located here: <https://www.hireright.com/login.aspx>

**How do I gain access to HireRight to initiate criminal background
checks?** \
Contact your unit security administrator to request access. Your unit
security administrator will need to forward your name and contact
information to Human Resources records
at <solutionscenter@hr.msu.edu> to request access to HireRight. The
subject line of the e-mail should state "HireRight Access for
Faculty/Academic Staff\".

**How do I get trained on using the criminal background check
system?** \
When you receive access to the HireRight system, you will also receive
an e-mail for access to HireRight University. HireRight University is
the official training website for the HireRight system. It provides 5
modules for you to enroll in and complete. Each module contains a short
quiz at the end. Training must be completed prior to accessing the
HireRight system.

**I was taking the training from HireRight University and module 6 asks
"Is your HireRight account adjudicated?" How should I answer this
question?** \
You should answer "Yes" to this question. MSU's account allows for
central HR review of all cases which are returned with a "pending"
status.

**I was taking the training from HireRight University and the modules
referenced a "Super User." Who is the "Super User"?** \
The Super User is Cheleane Clerkley, Senior Human Resources Professional
I/S. Cheleane Clerkley can be reached at 517-884-0131 or
at [chambe78@hr.msu.edu](mailto:chambe78@hr.msu.edu?subject=HireRight%20Inquiry).

**I was taking the training from HireRight University and the modules
referenced a flagging system. Are we using the flagging system?** \
Yes, MSU is utilizing the flagging system. However, it is only be
utilized as a tracking method for internal central HR purposes only.

**Are there additional resources available on how to initiate a
background check beyond the HireRight University training modules?** \
The HireRight system has a "Resources" section which contains training &
documentation materials. You may find the "Resources" section by logging
into the HireRight system and clicking the "Resources" section on the
left hand side of the screen.

[]{#Process}HireRight Process {#hireright-process xmlns=""}
-----------------------------

Please also refer to the [Criminal Background Check
policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/fas-policies-procedures/CriminalCheck.html "Criminal Background Check Policy") for
detailed information regarding the process.

**What does the criminal background check include?** \
The criminal background check will include the following:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Verification of Social Security Number
2.  Examination of county criminal records (county of current residence)
3.  Examination of state criminal records (recent residences)
4.  Examination of federal criminal records
5.  Examination of sex offender registry (nationwide)
6.  Examination of federal debarment lists
7.  Degree verification
:::

However, a more comprehensive criminal background check may be required
pursuant to state or federal law or for certain sensitive positions
(such as those with significant financial responsibilities).

**If a more comprehensive criminal background check is required (e.g.,
credit history, motor vehicle records), how do I proceed?** \
If a more comprehensive criminal background check is required, please
contact MSU HR at 517-353-4434. MSU HR will initiate criminal background
checks which require a more comprehensive background check.

**What is the average turnaround time after a criminal background check
has been submitted?** \
The average turnaround time after the criminal background check has been
submitted to HireRight is 72 hours. Delays in turnaround time do occur.
Please allow at least one to two weeks processing time for each
background check in the event of a delay. A delay can occur for any of
the following reasons:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The information has been entered incorrectly by the applicant or the
    requestor into the HireRight system.
2.  The institution listed by the applicant for degree verification does
    not accept an electronic authorization form. In these instances, a
    wet signature is needed by the applicant on the authorization form.
3.  The institution listed by the applicant for degree verification is
    delayed in providing a response to HireRight.
4.  The county or district listed for a background check in researching
    whether the applicant has any criminal felony or misdemeanor charges
    is delayed in providing a response to HireRight.
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
Additionally, a turnaround time of at least two weeks for a request that
is submitted for degree verification from an institution outside of the
United States can be expected. International institutions have different
practices and requirements which may cause a delay in HireRight\'s
verification process. In particular, degrees obtained from India require
that requests be mailed to the institution. Please allow for at least
two to three weeks processing time in these cases.
:::

**What information is required from the applicant in order to initiate
the criminal background check?** \
The following information is required:

    1.  First Name
    2.  Last Name
2.  Applicant Contact Information
    1.  Address

:::

\* Denotes if applicable. If not applicable, applicant should indicate
this.

**What if I need to run a criminal background check for a faculty or
academic staff member and he/she is a relative of mine?** \
If the faculty or academic staff member is a relative, another
authorized user in the unit will need to initiate the criminal
background check. If the unit does not have another authorized user,
central HR will initiate the criminal background check. In this
instance, please contact Academic Human Resources at 517-355-1526.

**My applicant has multiple degrees, but the system only allows the
applicant to enter one degree. Which degree should the applicant enter
into the background system?** \
The applicant should enter the highest degree earned. For example, if
the applicant has received a Masters degree, but is working towards a
PhD degree, the applicant should enter the Masters degree into
HireRight.

**What if an applicant does not hold a degree? Is the applicant still
required to undergo degree verification?** \
No. If the applicant does not hold a degree but is required to undergo a
criminal background check, the applicant should check the "Not
Applicable" box within the "Education Information" section of HireRight.

**What does it mean if I get an e-mail from HireRight stating the status
of the background check "Meets Company Standards"?** \
A status of "Meets Company Standards" means that the applicant has
satisfactory background check results.

**What does it mean if I get an e-mail from HireRight stating the status
of the background check is "pending"?** \
A status of "pending" may occur for a variety of reasons. Some common
reasons are:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  A discrepancy has been found regarding the applicant's degree
    information.
2.  An institution is not able to provide a response regarding degree
    verification.
3.  Criminal felony or misdemeanor records have been found on the
    applicant's record.
:::

All background checks with the status of "pending" require central HR
review. Central HR reviews background checks with a "pending" status
daily. After central HR review, you will either receive an e-mail
notification from HireRight stating that the status has been changed to
"Meets Company Standards" or you will be contacted by central HR for
additional follow-up.

**Am I authorized to view the results of the criminal background check
and degree verification?** \
You are not authorized to view the results of the criminal background
check. However, you are authorized to view the results of the degree
verification. To view the results, click on the applicant's name in the
HireRight system after the degree verification has been completed and
the degree verification results will appear.

::: {xmlns=""}
**What HireRight information is required for submission with AHR forms
(e.g., appointment form, change of status, reappointment form) for a
criminal background check?** \
Evidence of satisfactory completion of the criminal background check
must accompany AHR paperwork. The e-mail notification from HireRight
stating the applicant "Meets Company Standards" will suffice.
:::

Further, if the department initiates the criminal background check on
behalf of the candidate the original authorization form (all six pages)
must be submitted as an attachment to the appointment paperwork.

In most cases, the AHR pre-populated forms will indicate that a criminal
background check document or degree verification document is a required
attachment.

**Who is responsible for covering the cost of the background check?** \
The cost of the background checks is covered centrally.\
