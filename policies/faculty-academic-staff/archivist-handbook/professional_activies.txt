**4.1. Professional Activities**

It is important that archivists have the skills, knowledge, and
commitment necessary to provide appropriate levels of service. In
addition, scholarly and creative activities, as well as professional
service, are significant criteria considered in the evaluation process.
Therefore, professional development is an integral part of the UAHC's
efforts to fulfill its mission.

### **Release Time for Continuing Education** {#release-time-for-continuing-education .Default xmlns=""}

Archivists are encouraged to participate in conferences, seminars,
workshops, institutes, and other short-term activities and programs
designed to update their professional knowledge, competencies, and
job-related skills. Attendance and participation in these programs are a
normal and necessary activity. However, as attendance at meetings
affects the operation of the work unit when programs are held during
regular working hours, archivists must request approval from the
assistant director concerning participation in these programs.
Archivists may be asked to provide justification and expectations for
attendance at a conference and to produce a written report afterward.
Financial assistance for travel and program fees is given whenever
possible and appropriate.\
