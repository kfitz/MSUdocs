**1.2. Procedures for Establishing Positions**

The Director drafts a position description and submits to the search
committee for refinement. The Director is responsible for determining
the final composition of all search committees. The department may use
the same search committee for more than one vacancy. Each search
committee must have a member designated to act as affirmative action
advocate.

The filling of a vacant position and the establishment of a new position
is subject to approval by the Chief Information Officer and Director of
Information Technology. Once approved and returned to the Director, the
position can then be posted publicly through Academic Human Resources.\
