**Appendix B: Writing Goals and Objectives**

Archivists determine their goals and objectives for the upcoming year
based on their major areas of responsibility. The current job
description and ongoing projects should be used to determine
responsibilities. Each major area of responsibility should have at least
one goal. Goals are written definitions of what you expect to accomplish
within a given time period. A goal is not what you do, but the result
you want to achieve. Objectives are more specific and have measurable
outcomes. Objectives are the steps needed to achieve the goal.

The Anatomy of a Goal:

Goal Statement

What do I hope to accomplish?

Action Plan

What do I need to do?

What steps must I take and what is my timeline?

Performance Measure

How good is "good enough"?

How will I know that I have achieved this goal?

Goals should
be **SMART**: **S**pecific **M**easurable **A**ttainable **R**elevant **T**ime-limited

Examples:

Vague goal:

*"I want to improve the way we keep reference statistics."*

 Better goal:

*"Develop a new system for tracking reference queries and implement by
the start of the calendar year."*

Objectives for this goal:

*Determine which statistics related to reference are necessary to
maintain*

*Design and test a tracking database*

*Write up instructions and conduct training at a team meeting*

*Follow up with staff to determine if any problems\
