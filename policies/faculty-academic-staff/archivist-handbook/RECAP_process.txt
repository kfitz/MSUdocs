**2.2 RECAP Process (Reapppointment, Continuous Appointment, and
Promotion)**

The purpose of the evaluation process for reappointment, continuous
appointment, and promotion is to assess the individual archivist\'s
capacity for sustained professional effectiveness and continuing
professional growth in the Michigan State University Archives &
Historical Collections. Peer evaluation will be conducted by a committee
of at least three MSU faculty/academic staff members with appropriate
knowledge of archives or records management as appointed by the Director
of the University Archives.

The criteria for evaluating archivists for reappointment, continuous
appointment, and promotion are performance of responsibilities;
research, scholarly, and creative activities; and service and/or
professional activities. While each criterion is considered significant
in the archivist\'s contribution to the mission of the UAHC and the
University, performance of responsibilities is the most important of the
three criteria and therefore weighted most heavily in such
deliberations.
