Extensions of the probationary appointment may be requested from the
Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human
Resources for reasons related to childbirth, adoption, the care of an
ill and/or disabled child, spouse, or parent; personal illness; to
receive prestigious awards, fellowships, and/or special assignment
opportunities; or other such serious constraints.

To request an extension of the probationary appointment, the Director of
the University Archives must submit a memorandum to the Associate
Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources that
includes the following information:

1.  the specific reason delineated in this policy that justifies an
    exception to the standard procedures governing the Archivist
    continuous appointment system;
2.  clear explanation of the impact of the specified condition on the
    normal activities of the archivist;
3.  what is expected to be achieved at the end of the requested
    extension, including the prospects for success, and a description of
    the resources and/or proposed changes that will be made to
    facilitate success;
4.  a current curriculum vitae and a one-page summary of prior
    assignments and major duties during the previous three years for the
    archivist seeking the extension;
