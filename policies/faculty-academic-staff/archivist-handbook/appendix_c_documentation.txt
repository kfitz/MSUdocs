**Appendix C: Documentation for RECAP**

Documentation is required to support a candidate\'s application for
reappointment, continuous appointment or promotion. In addition to
documentation to support each of the criteria, each candidate should
supply the following:

1.  An up to date curriculum vitae that includes professional employment
    history, professional activities, community activities, courses
    taught, publications, awards, etc., which will be forwarded to the
    Provost for review with the recommendations.
2.  A brief letter of application concisely summarizing the candidate\'s
    strengths and contributions to the UAHC and stating the action being
    requested.
3.  Copies of any work done at MSU which is listed in the curriculum
    vitae. The RECAP committee may request copies of any other work
    listed on the curriculum vitae that it wishes to see.
4.  Names and addresses of persons other than the supervisor(s) who may
    be contacted to supply letters of reference.
    1.  Reappointment - The candidate will submit the names of at least
        3 persons other than the primary supervisor who may be contacted
        to supply letters of reference. These individuals will be asked
        (by the Director of the University Archives) to evaluate the
        candidate\'s performance and/or contributions to the UAHC and/or
        the archival profession. The candidate is strongly encouraged to
        provide at least 1 reference from outside the UAHC. A minimum of

        University Archives) to evaluate the candidate\'s performance
        and/or contributions to the UAHC and/or the archival profession.
        A minimum of 5 and no more than 7 letters will accompany the
        dossier.
    3.  For candidates applying for either reappointment or continuous
        appointment, there must be one name from at least three of the
        four following groups:
