**6.4 Elimination of Position**

::: {xmlns=""}
Positions can be eliminated due to loss of funding or changes in unit
directions and needs. Such position eliminations can occur regardless of
the rank or appointment status, i.e., fixed term, probationary or
continuing, of the individual filling the position. This section is
devoted to the procedures covering the elimination of academic
specialist positions. \

### 6.4.1 Fixed Term Appointment Ending Date

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
Ordinarily, a fixed term position will be eliminated at the end of the
current appointment period.
:::

When a fixed term position is to be eliminated prior to the ending date
of the current appointment, the effective date of separation from the
University normally shall be at least two months from the notice of
termination. However, this notice provision does not change the ending
date of the fixed term appointment in effect at the time termination
action is instituted. An additional fixed term appointment shall not be
implemented solely for the purpose of satisfying the two-month notice
period stipulated prior to termination.

### 6.4.2 Probationary Appointment

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
Availability of position funds and/or changes in the needs of the
department or unit may result in the non reappointment of an academic
specialist on a probationary appointment in the Academic Specialist
Appointment System. This decision requires written approval of the
dean/separately reporting director and the Provost. An academic
specialist with probationary appointment status normally will be
retained until the conclusion of the applicable probationary appointment
period, but not less than six months after receipt of the termination
notification.\

### 6.4.3 Continuing Appointment Elimination

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
Availability of position funds and/or changes in the needs of the
department or unit may result in the elimination of positions filled by
the academic specialist with continuing appointment status. This section
describes applicable procedures.\

### 6.4.3.1 Notification of Termination

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
If termination action is to be taken, the administrator must provide a
written termination notice to the academic specialist. An academic
specialist with continuing appointment status on an annual basis will be
terminated no earlier than one calendar year after receipt of the
termination notification. An academic specialist with continuing
appointment status and an academic year appointment will be terminated
no earlier than either the next August 15 or nine months after receiving
the termination notice, whichever occurs later.

### 6.4.3.2 Reassignment

An individual with continuing appointment status may be reassigned from
one Academic Specialist Appointment System position to another within
the same or in another academic unit with written approval of the
Provost and written recommendation of the unit administrator(s) and the
dean(s)/separately reporting director(s) involved. Such an individual
will normally serve a two-year probationary period; reappointment after
the probationary period will result in continuing appointment status.

### 6.4.3.3 Relocation

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
Assistance in finding alternative employment opportunities will be
afforded to the academic specialist in the Academic Specialist
Appointment System with continuing appointment status and is described
in the remainder of this section. This assistance is centered in the
Office of the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for
Academic Human Resources.
:::

For two years following termination, the Office of the Associate Provost
and Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources will provide
the individual with information about academic specialist employment
opportunities as these positions become available at the University.

During the two-year period following termination, the individual will be
given priority consideration for interviews for any open Academic
Specialist Appointment System position with duties and responsibilities
that are similar to those previously held.

If the individual is chosen for a new position within the Academic
Specialist Appointment System, that individual will normally serve a
two-year probationary period at the end of which the individual will be
eligible for continuing appointment status. Reappointment after the
probationary period will result in continuing appointment status.

The individual may, of course, exercise the regular opportunities to
apply for employment vacancies in the academic and University support
personnel systems within the University.

Letters of reference, contacts with other employers, and other
assistance may be provided when the academic specialist has a desire to
pursue alternate employment opportunities outside the University.\
