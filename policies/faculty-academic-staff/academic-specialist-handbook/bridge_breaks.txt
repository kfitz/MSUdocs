**7.12 Bridging Breaks in Service**

::: {xmlns=""}
To provide a consistent definition of continuing employment for
University employees, the policy for bridging breaks in service provides
that service breaks for academic specialists of twelve months or less
result in the reinstatement of the previous employment date for purposes
of retirement service credit and for fringe benefit eligibility. To
bridge breaks in service greater than ninety days and not more than
twelve months, the following conditions must be met:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   The employee must have a minimum of one year of service prior to the
    break in employment; and,
-   The maximum accumulation of bridged time is two years, i.e., the sum
    total of individual breaks in service cannot exceed two years.
:::

Approved leaves of absence do not constitute a break in service.

This policy will be implemented automatically by the Office of Academic
Human Resources at the time individuals are subsequently reappointed.
For individuals seeking to clarify their continuing employment status,
it will be necessary to submit a written request to Academic Human
Resources, 312 Administration Building. The following information should
be included in the written request: (1) Name (indicate if previously
employed under a different name); (2) Social Security Number, (3)
Present Department; (4) Previous Employment Date; (5) Separation Date;
and (6) Re-employment Date.

Questions regarding the bridging policy should be directed to Academic
Human Resources, 5-1526; contact Human Resources, 3-4434, regarding
eligibility for benefit coverages.\
