Academic Specialist Manual

**4.3 Appointment Period**

An academic specialist in the Academic Specialist Appointment System is
appointed on either an academic year or an annual basis. The
University\'s basic appointment commitment to an academic specialist in
the Academic Specialist Appointment System is for an academic year
(nine-month) appointment period ( [see Section
4.6](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-specialist-handbook/change_annual_ay.html "Annual to Academic year appointment")
). Annual (twelve-month) appointments may be provided based on the
mission and needs of the appointing unit and/or the individual\'s
specific duties. \
\
The appointment may be either on a full-time basis (100%) or part-time.
Part-time probationary or continuing appointments must be for 50% time
or greater. Only fixed term appointments may be for less than 50% time.\
