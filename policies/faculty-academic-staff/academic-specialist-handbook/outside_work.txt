**7.9 Consulting and Outside Work**

::: {xmlns=""}
Consulting and outside work for entities other than the University are
areas that require careful balance of the rights and responsibilities of
the University and the individual with the missions of the University.
Academic specialists may engage in outside activities that fall outside
the duty assignment for the University. Questions of conflict of
interest should be addressed to the responsible administrator or
forwarded to the Associate Provost/Associate Vice President for Academic
Human Resources or the Vice President for Research and Graduate
Studies.\
