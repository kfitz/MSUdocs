**7.4 Identification Cards**

::: {xmlns=""}
All academic specialists are encouraged to obtain identification cards.
The identification cards are useful for campus privileges. It is
inappropriate to alter, falsify, or misuse an MSU I.D. card.
:::

To obtain an ID Card, the academic specialist may visit either the ID
Office located in Room 170 International Center, 8:00-5:00, Monday
through Friday or Human Resources, Room 110 Nisbet Building, Monday
through Friday, 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.  A government issued photo I.D.
(drivers license, passport, etc.) is necessary for processing.

Spouses of academic specialists may obtain IDs entitling them to certain
privileges. To obtain the spouse card, the employee and spouse must both
appear in person, present the employee\'s Michigan State University ID,
proof of marriage, and a government issued photo such as a driver\'s
license or passport. There is no charge for the initial card. The cards
are available at either the ID Office or Human Resources during the
hours listed above.\
