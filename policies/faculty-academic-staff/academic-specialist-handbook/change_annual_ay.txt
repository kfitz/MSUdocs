**4.6 Changes from Annual to Academic Year Appointment**

The University\'s basic appointment commitment to an academic specialist
in the Academic Specialist Appointment System is for an academic year
(nine-month) appointment period. If changes in the unit\'s mission,
needs, or the individual\'s duties occur, a specialist appointed on an
annual basis can be shifted to an academic year appointment basis, the
University\'s basic appointment commitment, with the appropriate
reduction in salary as stipulated by the regular procedure for changing
appointments from an annual to academic year basis. The academic year
salary rates are set at an amount equal to 9/11 of the current annual
salary rate, after exclusion of administrative increments, if any. This
policy applies exclusively to those individuals who were first appointed
to annual appointments on or after January 1, 1982.\
