**7.3 Jury Duty**

::: {xmlns=""}
The University recognizes the civic responsibility of academic
specialists to serve jury duty and makes provision for them to perform
such duty without loss of pay or benefits.
:::

Academic specialists serving on jury duty who are absent from work for
80 continuous hours or less will receive their regular pay and are not
required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the University. They
must, however, notify the department chairperson/school director of the
call to jury duty as soon as it is received.

Academic specialists serving on jury duty who are absent from work for
more than 80 continuous hours must notify the department
chairperson/school director of the call to jury duty as soon as it is
received and are required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the
Payroll Office. The academic specialist will receive the difference
between the pay received from the court and normal base pay.

In all cases, the academic specialist is expected to report for regular
University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at court.

Full cooperation is expected between the academic specialist, unit
administrator and department(s) involved to insure minimal disruption in
the instructional and service responsibilities of the unit.\
