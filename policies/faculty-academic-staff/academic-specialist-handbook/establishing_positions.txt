**3.4 Procedure for Establishing Positions**

::: {xmlns=""}
All academic specialist positions must be established using the same
position request and review procedures required for all academic
personnel system positions (see [Academic Hiring
Manual](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-hiring-manual/index.html "Academic Hiring Manual")).
Additionally, a [Specialist Position Description
form](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/forms/faculty-academic-staff/info-spd.html "Info about Specialist Position Description Form") must
be completed.
:::

To be approved, academic specialist positions must include duties and
responsibilities which are not covered by or adequately provided for in
current support staff classifications. The Office of the Provost may
consult with the Office of Human Resources as a part of the review
procedure for the establishment of probationary, continuing or fixed
term positions within the Academic Specialist Appointment System.\
