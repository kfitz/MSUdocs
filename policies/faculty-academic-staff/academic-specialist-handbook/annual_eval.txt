Academic Specialist Manual

**5.2 Annual Evaluation**

The academic specialist with a probationary appointment shall be
evaluated annually to determine progress toward goals and/or the
identification of goals. Units may also use the annual evaluation to
assist in the assignment of merit and other salary adjustments. The
academic specialist with a continuing appointment must also be
evaluated. Units may schedule such evaluations to meet the needs and
concerns of the individual unit; however, the unit must follow the
established procedures.\
\
**5.2.1 Notification of Evaluation**

The academic specialist shall be notified when the evaluation is to take
place, what procedures are to be followed, and what criteria are to be
used for the evaluation. This notification should be at the time of
appointment and, subsequently, two months prior to the evaluation.\
\
**5.2.3 Fixed Term Academic Specialist**

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
An academic specialist with a fixed term appointment should be reviewed
regardless of the probability of reappointment in order to assess
progress toward goals and/or the identification of goals. The academic
specialist appointed on a fixed term basis for six months or more shall
be evaluated by the unit administrator no later than two months prior to
the appointment ending date. A summary of this evaluation shall be
placed in the personnel file in the unit and be given to the academic
specialist.\
