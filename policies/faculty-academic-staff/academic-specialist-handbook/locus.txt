**3.1 Locus of Appointments**

The academic specialist may hold a position requiring performance of
advising/teaching/curriculum development, research, or service/outreach
duties. Appointment as an academic specialist is limited to academic
units which report (directly or indirectly) to the Office of the Provost
or to the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. The academic
specialist may be appointed in the Academic Specialist Appointment
System on a continuing basis, on a probationary basis, or on a fixed
term basis (appointments with ending dates) (see Sections
[4.8](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-specialist-handbook/cont_probationary_apps.html)
and
