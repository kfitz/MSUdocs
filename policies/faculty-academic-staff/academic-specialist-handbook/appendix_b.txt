**Appendix B. Guidelines for Specialist Placements**

::: {xmlns=""}
The following guidelines have been developed to describe the major types
of specialist appointments and the duties they perform. These guidelines
are to assist in making appropriate placements in the specialist system.
However, since it is not possible to address every possible situation in
the guidelines, each case will be evaluated on its individual merits.
:::

**TEACHING/ADVISING/CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Teaching specialists provide instruction for credit courses.
    Teaching and related class preparation, grading, student evaluation,
    etc., are substantial and continuing dimensions of ongoing
    responsibilities (i.e., occupying at least 30% of the time). These
    specialists are the instructors of record or teach portions of
    courses on a regular basis entailing the time commitment referenced
    above. Occasional teaching assignments cannot satisfy assignment to
    this specialist category.
2.  Advising specialists devote the preponderance of their time (50%+)
    to advising students on course selection, degree requirements,
    majors, etc., and/or to other instructional activities, e.g.,
    tutoring, interpreting for students with disabilities or bilingual
    students, advising on academic developmental needs, and developing
    instructional strategies to assist academic progress. Advising may
    include career counseling, but this is incidental to the major focus
    of course and curriculum advice.
3.  Curriculum development specialists provide content-related support
    to course, curriculum and/or instructional development activities.
    At least 30% of time must be devoted to these activities to satisfy
    assignment to this specialist category.
4.  Beyond the assignments referenced in a), b), and c), above, time may
    be spent on research, administration, outreach, or other activities.
:::

**RESEARCH**

Research specialists take a lead role on research projects, including
developing grant proposals, and directing the research project with
designation as principal investigator or performing position
responsibilities which require a doctorate degree.

**OUTREACH**

Outreach specialists are responsible for disseminating the knowledge
resources of the University, to meet the knowledge needs of people
outside the University.

Their work involves providing non-credit educational programs to
off-campus students or client groups, including course development and
presentation, and/or providing a linkage for those outside the
University to identify and access faculty knowledge, resources, and
research results. This can involve technology transfer which provides a
linkage between external University, public and faculty research
resources to help resolve complex technological issues and/or share
technological or scientific knowledge. These duties must involve a time
commitment of at least 30%.

In addition to these responsibilities, outreach specialists may be
involved in proposal writing, resource identification, and data
gathering. Outreach specialists also can be designated as principal
investigators. They can be appointed through any college as part of the
newly decentralized Lifelong Education Program or through a college
which has technological/research resources to share with the outside
public.

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

Typically, a specialist\'s education is at the master\'s level, or
above.

Specialists are appointed in units reporting directly or indirectly to
the Provost or the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.

The above specialist responsibilities can be contrasted with AP
positions, which focus on administrative or professional
responsibilities, and may include:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   teaching technical skills, technological information, or non-credit
    courses to other staff or students;
-   writing grants or providing research support (but not being
    designated as the principal investigator or where a doctorate is
    required).
:::

When evaluating a mixed assignment of specialist and non-specialist work
(e.g., part advising, part administrative), an individual must meet one
of the percentages specified in the guidelines to be placed as a
specialist (e.g., 30% teaching, 30% curriculum development, 50% advising
or 30% outreach). An individual with a mixed assignment of two types of
specialist work, e.g., 20% advising and 20% curriculum development,
would be considered to meet the specialist guidelines if the combined
duties meet one of the specified percentages.

Individuals who supervise or direct a specialist function (e.g.,
supervision of a group of advisors) would typically be categorized as
the same type of specialist (unless they hold another academic rank).

::: {xmlns=""}
The above guidelines were developed jointly between the Offices of the
Provost and Human Resources, with the assistance of Lifelong Education
Programs and after consultation with the Deans\' Counsel. The guidelines
may require further clarification based upon implementation experience
and, therefore, may be changed by the University.\
