**4.9 Fixed Term Appointments**

::: {xmlns=""}
An academic specialist may be appointed on a fixed term basis for
variable periods of time on an academic year or annual basis. Such
appointments may be either full-time (100%) or part-time (any percentage
less than 100%). In accordance with regular University procedures,
unless an explicit written commitment for an additional appointment,
fixed term or otherwise, is provided by the unit administrator, the
academic specialist cannot expect to be reappointed. For all fixed term
(temporary) faculty/academic staff appointments, as stated in the
Faculty Handbook, \"the University has no obligation to provide
reappointment or extension of a fixed term appointment beyond the ending
date. If reappointment is made, negotiation of the conditions of
reappointment must originate with the administrative unit (department,
school, institute, residential college, or other comparable academic
unit).\" As indicated in the fixed term faculty/academic staff
appointment memorandum\--required to be filled out for each fixed term
appointment/reappointment\--appointment or reappointment on a fixed term
basis does not involve any commitment to appointment in any of the
continuing academic personnel appointment systems, which require
separate and distinct procedures.
:::

Units are required to provide academic specialists with fixed term
appointments a notice about reappointment or the likelihood of
reappointment three months prior to the end date of the appointment.\
