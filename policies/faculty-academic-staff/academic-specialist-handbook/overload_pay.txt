**7.8 Overload Pay**

1.  Overload pay is limited to overload work related to instruction and
    service activities.
2.  Overload pay assignments require prior written approval of the
    chairperson/director of the applicable department/school and the
    dean of the applicable college/director of the separately reporting
    unit. Requests must describe the proposed activity.
3.  Full-time academic specialists are eligible for overload pay
    provided the total time expended does not exceed an average of
    four (4) days per month.
4.  An overload assignment must meet the following minimum criteria:
    -   Overload pay is appropriate since the designated academic
        specialist is fully assigned in the department, school or other
        unit and is satisfactorily performing assigned duties;
    -   The proposed assignment, in the opinion of the
        chairperson/director in consultation with the dean, represents a
        substantial increase over and above the academic specialist\'s
        regularly assigned duties, thus warranting the provision of
        overload pay.
5.  Overload pay must be approved by the chairperson/director of the
    department or school and dean of the college/director of the
    separately reporting unit in which the academic specialist is
    appointed. Annually the Office of Planning and Budgets shall provide
    to the Office of the Provost and the deans a summary of overload pay
    disbursements made in the prior fiscal year.
6.  During the summer, academic specialists appointed on an academic
    year basis may receive up to 3/9 of their previous year\'s salary
    for a full-time assignment in teaching, research and service. In
    addition, pursuant to the provisions of this policy, they may be
    eligible to receive overload pay.
7.  Academic Specialists serving as academic administrators may receive
    overload pay for assignments related to their disciplines and
    professions but normally not for assignments related to their
    administrative positions.
8.  In recognition of collegial expectations usual in a community of
    scholars, payment of honoraria to MSU academic specialists for
    talks, seminars, etc., provided in usual classroom/seminar settings
    is not permitted.
9.  Major administrative units may establish a more restrictive policy.
    Assignments which might normally justify the payment of overload pay
    may, by mutual agreement, be compensated for by subsequent release
    time for research, through the assignment of additional graduate
    assistants/other staff support, or other programmatic support.
