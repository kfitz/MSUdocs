professional misconduct, including, but not limited to (1) intellectual
dishonesty; (2) acts of discrimination, including harassment, prohibited
by law or University policy; (3) acts of moral turpitude substantially
related to the fitness of faculty members to engage in teaching,
research, service/outreach and/or administration; (4) theft or misuse of
University property; (5) incompetence; (6) refusal or failure to perform
reasonable assigned duties; (7) use of professional authority to exploit
others; (8) violation of University policy substantially related to

\
**6.2.1 Dismissal Procedure**

Before initiating dismissal of an academic specialist, the unit
administrator shall confer with the dean/separately reporting director,
who shall confer with the Provost to determine if dismissal is
appropriate. The academic specialist shall be informed in writing of
reasons for the proposed dismissal, with an explanation of supporting
information, and shall be given an opportunity to discuss the matter
with the unit administrator or other appropriate administrator(s). In
cases in which the academic specialist is not in the United States or is
otherwise not available, the opportunity to discuss the matter will be
met by a telephone discussion and/or correspondence that provides a
reasonable opportunity to respond. The academic specialist may provide
information, orally and/or in writing, in support of his/her position
and in response to the reasons for dismissal set forth by the unit
administrator. The academic specialist may be accompanied by counsel,
and the responsible administrator may also be advised by counsel. If the
responsible administrator(s) determine that dismissal is warranted,
dismissal may immediately take place.\
\
**6.2.2 Notification of Separation**

If dismissal action is to be taken, the administrator must provide a
written notice to the academic specialist including the reasons for
dismissal, date of separation/dismissal, and a statement that the
academic specialist may file a grievance under the Faculty Grievance
Policy. No duties or responsibilities will be performed after the
separation/dismissal date.\
