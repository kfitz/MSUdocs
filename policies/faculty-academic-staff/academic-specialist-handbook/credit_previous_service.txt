**4.7 Credit for Previous Service Toward Probationary Appointments**

If the individual\'s current appointment as an academic specialist at
the University is on a fixed term basis (with ending date), on a
continuing appointment basis (without end date) in another unit, in
another appointment category in the University or in employment outside
of the University, and a request is made to recommend appointment of
that individual to a position in the Academic Specialist Appointment
System, such previous appointment service may be counted toward the
Academic Specialist Appointment System probationary periods. The major
criteria for awarding credit for previous service are the level of
performance and similarity of duties in the previous and new positions.
Requests for recognition of prior employment service as applicable to
Academic Specialist Appointment System service requires a written
recommendation by the unit administrator, written concurrence of the
dean/separately reporting director, and the written approval of the
Provost.
