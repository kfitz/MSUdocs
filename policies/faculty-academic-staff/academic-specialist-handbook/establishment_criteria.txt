**3.2 Criteria for Establishment**

Academic specialist positions should be established only if this is the
best way for the academic unit to function at the highest possible level
of effectiveness and efficiency within available resources. Academic
specialist positions are established on the recommendation of the
appropriate administrator of the academic unit, the concurrence of the
appropriate dean/separately reporting director, and require approval by
the Office of the Provost.\
