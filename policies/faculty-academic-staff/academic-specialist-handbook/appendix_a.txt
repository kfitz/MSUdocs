**Appendix A. Functional Description of Specialist Duties, Advancement
in the System and Administrative Responsibilities**

::: {xmlns=""}
This appendix describes the general nature of academic specialist duties
in specified functional areas including criteria for advancement in the
Academic Specialist Appointment System as well as for administrative
assignment. The specific description of duties, including the
partitioning of effort among functional areas will be contained in the
specific position description for the individual at the time of
appointment. Advancement based on an individual\'s responsibilities in
more than one functional area would, of course, depend on an
appropriately weighted assessment of that individual in each area of
responsibility. Identification of a primary functional area for the
individual will be done by the Associate Provost and Associate Vice
President for Academic Human Resources as part of the position
establishment procedures in accordance with established guidelines.
:::

**A.1 TERMS OF APPOINTMENT\
**Individuals who are appointed in the Academic Specialist Appointment
System may hold the rank of academic specialist or senior academic
specialist. Appointments may be made in any academic unit that reports
directly or indirectly to the Provost or the Vice President for Research
and Graduate Studies. Individuals appointed in the Academic Specialist
Appointment System will have ongoing student and faculty interactions,
contribute directly to the academic affairs of the unit and must
accomplish the goals and objectives of the department, school, college
or other designated academic unit.

The academic credentials and the appropriate educationally related
experiences and specific duties will vary depending on the nature of the
appointment; however, it is expected that the academic specialist will
normally have a primary assignment in either academic
advising/teaching/curriculum development, research or service/outreach,
but may also have other responsibilities including one or more of the
referenced functional areas. Changes in characteristics and/or
responsibilities of the position are more likely to result in a change
in administrative title or functional area designation rather than a
change in rank to that of senior academic specialist. Promotion to the
rank of senior academic specialist, reappointment and the award of
continuing appointment status will be determined using the guidelines of
the Academic Specialist Appointment System.

**A.2 MERIT AS A BASIS FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION\
**Reappointment of the academic specialist, including the award of
continuing appointment status and promotion to the rank of senior
academic specialist, must be based on meritorious performance, not
merely time spent in the position. General characteristics and
responsibilities are included in later sections specific to the
particular functional areas. However, the underlying premise is that
individuals appointed as academic specialists are professionals
dedicated to the performance of their responsibilities, the advancement
of the University and maintaining Michigan State University as a premier
land-grant, AAU University. The listing of criteria is not intended to
be exhaustive. Nor would a single individual necessarily be measured by
all the criteria related to a given functional group, even if the duties
of that individual fell only within one functional area. Rather, the
individual would be evaluated according to the subset of criteria from
each functional area involved that is appropriate to the particular
position.

**A.3 GENERAL PROCESS FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION\
**Reappointment, including the award of continuing appointment status
and promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist, is predicated
on the exemplary performance of assigned duties, professional
development, excellence in scholarly activity, leadership and
contributions to the institution.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Consistent with the reappointment/promotion timetable, individuals
    who believe they have developed an appropriate record of activity
    and competence may assemble a compendium of scholarly achievements
    and submit such documentation to support consideration for
    reappointment or promotion. Such documentation may consist of
    evidence to substantiate excellence in relevant scholarly
    activities, i.e., course/curriculum development, teaching,
    publications, public service/outreach, academic advising, grants,
    creativity in program development and leadership in other areas
    related to assigned duties.
-   It is to be recognized that no one individual is to be required to
    perform or excel in all three functional areas. The initial or
    subsequent appointment description defines the basic area(s) in
    which the individual should devote energy and attention in career
    progression.
-   The unit review committee for academic specialist reappointment or
    promotion should be provided with guidelines and directed to
    determine objectively the level of accomplishment and excellence in
    the relevant academic specialist functional area(s) and specific
    duty assignments. Each academic specialist is to be evaluated based
    on individual merit.
-   Recommendations of the review committee are forwarded to the
    appropriate academic unit administrator. The recommendation of the
    academic unit administrator is forwarded for subsequent review and
    action by the relevant major academic unit administrator (usually
    the dean) and by the Office of the Provost.
-   Upon approval by the Provost, the academic specialist will be
    notified of the recommended action.
:::

**A.4 PROMOTION TO THE RANK OF SENIOR ACADEMIC SPECIALIST **\
In addition to excellence in performance which warrants reappointment
and/or continuing appointment status, a small number of academic
specialists may achieve a level of distinction to justify promotion to
the rank of senior academic specialist. Such a distinction is to be
limited to a small number of individuals appointed in the academic
specialist appointment system. The basis for such a promotion
recommendation is to be derived from a significantly long and sustained
period of excellence in the performance of assigned duties together with
the recognition by peers and colleagues both within the University and
regionally, nationally and internationally. Such recognition is to be
based on external peer review involving evaluation of performance in one
or more of the assigned functional areas: teaching/advising/curriculum
development, research, public service/outreach. Only in unusual cases
would an individual not previously appointed at Michigan State
University be appointed at the rank of senior academic specialist. This
rank designation is limited to individuals who either have continuing
appointment status or would achieve such a status on positive
recommendation for promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist.
Academic specialists with fixed term appointments who have completed 60
FTE service months are eligible for promotion to senior academic
specialist, subject to the same standards and criteria applicable to
individuals in the continuing appointment system. (Specialists with
fixed term appointments are not eligible for the rank of senior academic
specialist upon appointment). A promotion recommendation requires
endorsement not only by the immediate academic unit administrator but by
intermediate administrators (usually the Dean) and the Provost.

**A.5 CHARACTERISTICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\
**The principal activities of academic specialists are confined to three
functional areas (academic advising/teaching/curriculum development,
research and service/outreach). Guidance for the assignment of academic
specialists to one of the three functional areas and on whether a
particular position should be placed within the Academic Specialist
Appointment System is described in a document entitled Guidelines for
Specialist Placements, which appears as Appendix B. **The characteristic
duties and responsibilities included in Section A.5. are not intended to
supersede the guidelines for specialist placements but only to provide
examples of typical activities.**

As noted, each academic specialist is classified as being in one
functional area in which the individual expends a relevantly significant
amount of effort in assigned duties. The academic specialist routinely
will have duties which fall into more than one functional area plus
other assignments. The specific description of assigned duties is
contained in the job description for the individual position.
Reappointment/continuing appointment status and promotion of an
individual with responsibilities in multiple functional areas will
depend on an appropriately weighted assessment of performance in each
area. The following detailed descriptions provide a suggested array of
duties that may be performed by academic specialists; they are not
intended as listings of required job duties.
