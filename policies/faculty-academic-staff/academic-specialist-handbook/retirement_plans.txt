**8.3 Retirement Plans**

::: {xmlns=""}
Academic specialists appointed in a benefits eligible position at 50
percent time or more for a period of nine months or more are eligible to
make contributions to the 403(b) Base Retirement Program as well as the
403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program or the 457(b) Deferred
Compensation Plan.
:::

**403(b) Base Retirement Program**

Eligibility\
Participation in the 403(b) Base Retirement Program, with University
contribution, generally is initially voluntary and required for academic
specialists when certain service and/or age requirements are met. More
information is available at [403(b) Base Retirement
Program](/benefits/retirement/403b-base.html "403(b) Base Retirement Program").
The general rules follow:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Academic specialists with probationary or continuing appointments of
    50 percent time or more may elect immediate participation with
    University contribution. A specialist who does not have a
    probationary or continuing appointment will become eligible for the
    University contribution 24 FTE service months from the date of
    initial appointment. Participation for all specialists is required
    after 24 FTE service months and attaining age 35.
2.  Academic Specialists appointed 50 percent time or more for nine
    months or more who are not immediately eligible to participate may
    enroll if the specialist participated in a 403(b), 401(a), 401(k) or
    other retirement plan at a previous employer that made employer
    contributions.
3.  Once required participation commences for academic specialists
    appointed for nine months or more, the academic specialist must
    continue contributing to the 403(b) Base Retirement Program while
    employed at the University.
4.  Academic specialists may complete the enrollment process in the
    403(b) Base Retirement Program online through the EBS Portal.
:::

Coverage\
The 403(b) Base Retirement program provides a retirement income based
upon the total amount accumulated from the employee\'s contribution, the
University\'s contribution, and the earnings on those amounts over the
period of the working years.

The 403(b) Base Retirement Program is fully vested indicating that both
the academic specialist\'s and the University\'s contributions are
placed directly in the academic specialist\'s account each month. In the
event the academic specialist leaves the University, ownership of the
total accumulation is retained by the academic specialist. An academic
specialist may commence to draw his/her accumulation under a variety of
payment options after leaving the University. The academic specialist
may elect to receive an immediate retirement income or may defer the
receipt of his/her retirement income until a later date.

Cost\
The 403(b) Base Retirement Program is financed by a reduction of 5% from
the academic specialist\'s base salary and a matching University
contribution of 10%.1

**403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program and 457(b) Deferred
Compensation Plan\
**

Academic specialists appointed at 50% time or more for a period of at
least nine (9) months may make additional tax-deferred contributions to
the 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan subject to IRS limitations. More
detail is available at [457(b) Deferred Compensation
Plan](/benefits/retirement/457-def.html "457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan").\
\
All academic specialists are eligible to make additional tax-deferred
contributions to the 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program subject to
IRS limitations. More detail is available online at [403(b) Supplemental
Retirement
Program](/benefits/retirement/403b-supp.html "403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program"). \
\
Participation in the 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program and/or the
457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan is never required, and no matching
contribution is made by MSU.

**Other Retirement Information**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  To be considered an \"official\" retiree from Michigan State
    University (see the [Retiring from the University
    Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retirement.html "Retiring from the University")
    for more detail), academic specialists must meet one of the
    following minimum University retirement requirements: \
    -   Be at least 62 years of age and have completed 15 years of
        service, or
    -   Have completed 25 years of service at any age.
2.  Academic specialists meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements will remain eligible to maintain health and dental
    coverage and receive a University contribution toward the premiums
    based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at
    retirement (see the [Retiree Benefits
    Policy](/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retiree_benefits.html "Retiree Benefits")
    for more detail). Retirees (their spouse or other eligible
    individual) age 65 and over are required to enroll for Medicare
    Parts A & B at which time MSU\'s health plan coverage is adjusted to
    a Medicare supplement policy. Medicare Part B requires a monthly
    premium that is not reimbursed by MSU. Individuals may contact their
    local Social Security office for information on the monthly premium
    cost for Medicare Part B.\
    \
    Access to retiree health coverage is based on employment date:\
    \
    Faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date prior
    to July 1, 2005 and meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements will remain eligible to maintain health and dental
    coverage and receive a University contribution toward the premiums
    based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at
    retirement.\
    \
    For faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on
    or after July 1, 2005 and before July 1, 2010, the University will
    contribute to the lowest cost health plan\'s single rate for which
    the employee/retiree is eligible. (The contribution is based on the
    full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at the time of
    retirement). At retirement, the employee must designate whether the
    employee receives the University contribution or whether the
    contribution is to be split 50/50 between the employee and his/her
    spouse or other eligible individual. This designation is irrevocable
    regardless of circumstance, including returning to work or death.
    The designation of the 50/50 contribution is also non-transferable
    to future spouses or other eligible individuals.

    Faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on or
    after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for a University contribution to
    health care benefits. Retiree health coverage is available through
    the university at cost.

3.  Academic specialists meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements may continue participation in the employee-paid life
    program after retirement until age 70.
4.  Academic specialists participating in the employee-paid life plan at
    the time of retirement and who were enrolled prior to July 1, 1976
    will receive a \$2,000 life benefit fully paid by the University.
