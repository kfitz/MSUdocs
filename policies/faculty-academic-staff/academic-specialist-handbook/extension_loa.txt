**4.4 Extension of Probationary Appointments for Leaves of Absence**

An academic specialist with probationary status who is granted a leave
of absence of six to twelve months will have the appointment period
extended by one year. Additional leaves of absence without pay of six to
twelve months will result in further one-year extension(s). For leaves
of absence without pay of three to six months, the probationary
appointment period may be extended by one year by mutual agreement.\
