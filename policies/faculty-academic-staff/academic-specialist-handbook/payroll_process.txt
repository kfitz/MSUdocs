**7.2 Payroll Procedures**

::: {xmlns=""}
The following items must be furnished to the Payroll Division of the
Office of the Controller before a new academic specialist can be put on
the University payroll:
:::

**SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.** Social security numbers must be verified by
the Payroll Office, 350 Administration Building, prior to the first pay
date. Verification may be completed by presenting the social security
card to the Payroll Office or by sending a photocopy to that office.

**EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING ALLOWANCE CERTIFICATE (FORM W-4)**. The W-4 form
authorizes the University to recognize the appropriate exemptions when
calculating withholding taxes.

New academic specialists should at the same time complete the
appropriate forms in the Human Resources Office to participate in such
programs as employee-paid life, health and dental coverage, accidental
death and dismemberment, and base and supplemental retirement benefits.
All benefit programs are described briefly in the [Benefits
section](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-specialist-handbook/auto_benefits.html "Benefits Section") of
this handbook. Additional information is available from Human Resources,
110 Nisbet Building, 517-353-4434 or 1-800-353-4434, extension 536.\
