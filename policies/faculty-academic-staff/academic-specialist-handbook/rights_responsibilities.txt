**2.0 General Academic Rights and Responsibilities**

::: {xmlns=""}
Academic specialists have rights and responsibilities which flow from
particular appointment contexts as well as from their general
affiliation with Michigan State University. Any statement of rights and
associated responsibilities connotes a reciprocating expectation of
performance by both the academic specialist and the University. Academic
specialists are covered by applicable policies adopted by the Michigan
State University Board of Trustees and those implemented through
administrative action. Board of Trustees policies appear as actions
recorded in the minutes of the Board and are reproduced in the Board of
Trustees Policy Manual, the Faculty Handbook, and other University
publications.
:::

Academic specialists have other rights and responsibilities which
specifically flow from their assigned duties and responsibilities.
Normally, academic specialists are assigned to duties and
responsibilities performed by faculty members but with a more narrow
scope and focus. These assignments involve teaching, advising,
curriculum development, research, and public service/outreach. As
applicable in particularly assigned duties, academic specialists are
expected to serve as scholars in the pursuit of knowledge and its free
expression, as teachers and/or advisors, in providing instruction and
advice to students, and as professionals and citizens contributing their
special knowledge and skills through public service/outreach and
community participation. Fundamentally, academic specialists perform
their teaching/advising/curriculum development, research, and public
service/outreach responsibilities in ways to ensure academic freedom and
responsibility, a context essential to the University\'s goal of
advancing the unfettered search for knowledge and its free exposition.
For academic specialists, the principal elements of academic freedom
applicable to relevant assigned duties include:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The right, as teachers, to discuss in the classroom any material
    which has a significant relationship to the subject matter as
    defined in the approved course description;
2.  The right to determine course content, grading and classroom
    procedures of courses they teach;
3.  The right, as an academic advisor, to exercise judgment in good
    faith in advising students on curriculum, class, and career choices;
4.  The right to engage in curriculum development activities;
5.  The right to conduct research and to engage in creative endeavors;
6.  The right to publish or present research findings and creative work;
7.  The right to engage in public service/outreach activities;
8.  The right to seek changes in institutional policies through
    established University procedures and by lawful and peaceful means.
:::

Academic freedom carries with it responsibilities for academic
specialists, and principal elements include:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The responsibility to carry out assigned
    teaching/advising/curriculum development, research and public
    service/outreach duties in a professional manner in keeping with
    University policies;
2.  The responsibility, as teachers, to refrain from introducing matters
    which are not consistent with their teaching duties and professional
    competence and which have no significant bearing on the subject
    matter of the course as approved under University procedures;
3.  The responsibility, as academic advisors, to adhere to the policies
    governing privacy of student records;
4.  The responsibility to pursue excellence and intellectual honesty in
    teaching, research and other creative endeavors, and public
    service/outreach activities; and in publishing or presenting
    research findings and creative work;
5.  The responsibility to encourage students and colleagues to engage in
    free discussion and inquiry; and to evaluate student and colleague
    performance on a scholarly basis;
6.  The responsibility to work in a collegial manner with appropriate
    individuals and bodies to encourage the search for knowledge, its
    free exposition, and the University\'s continuing quest for
    excellence;
7.  The responsibility to differentiate carefully their official
    activities as academic specialists from their personal activities as
    citizens and, when the situation warrants, to make it clear that,
    when speaking as private citizens, they do not speak for the
    University.
