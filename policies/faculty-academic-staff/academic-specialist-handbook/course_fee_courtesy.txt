    the continuous employment system, full-time-specialists with
    continuing appointments in the Academic Specialist Appointment
    System, individuals appointed full-time in the Cooperative Extension
    Service continuing employment system, individuals appointed
    full-time in the Continuing Faculty Appointment System for the
    Facility for Rare Isotope Beams/National Superconducting Cyclotron
    Laboratory, individuals appointed full-time in executive management
    positions and other continuing positions (appointments without end
    dates) in the Academic Personnel System, full-time Health Programs
    faculty members upon the commencement of the first additional
    appointment, full-time fixed term faculty and academic staff with at
    least 60 Full-Time-Equivalent (FTE) service months, and those who

3.  Dependent children shall be defined as (a) all legally dependent
    children of eligible faculty or staff; and (b) such children who
    have eligible faculty or staff as their legal guardians.
4.  Dependent spouse shall be defined as the legally recognized spouse
    of an eligible faculty or staff member.

    fees, taxes and charges as may be collected for third parties.
7.  The course fee courtesy will be granted through the semester in
    which the 120th credit is attempted provided the dependent child or
    spouse/same-sex domestic partner is registered as a student in good
    academic standing at Michigan State University in a curriculum
    leading to the first baccalaureate degree or to a certificate in the
    Agricultural Technology program. For undergraduate students with
    transferable credits, the course fee courtesy is granted through the
    semester in which the combination of transferable credits and
    Michigan State University credits attempted equals 120.
8.  Except as stipulated below, the Course Fee Courtesy for dependent
    children and spouse/same-sex domestic partner will be discontinued
    at the conclusion of the semester or summer session at which the
    employment of the eligible faculty or staff member is terminated.
    The dependent children and spouse of an eligible faculty or staff
    member participating in the University\'s Long-Term Disability
    Program or who dies while on active service or while participating
    in the University\'s Long-Term Disability Program retain eligibility
    as if the eligible faculty or staff member were still living or were
    not participating in the University\'s Long-Term Disability Program
    as long as they meet the other eligibility requirements of the
    Course Fee Courtesy Policy. The dependent children and
    spouse/same-sex domestic partner of eligible faculty or staff
    members who retire in accordance with Michigan State University\'s
    retirement policy also retain eligibility as long as they meet the
    other eligibility requirements of the Course Fee Courtesy Policy.
9.  If the dependent child or spouse/same-sex domestic partner drops
    courses or withdraws from school during the refund period, any
    refund applicable to the course fee courtesy will revert to the
    University.
10. Dependent children and spouse/same-sex domestic partner of eligible
    faculty and staff on approved leave of absence will be eligible for
    the course fee courtesy.
