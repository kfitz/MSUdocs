**8.4 Academic Specialist Benefits in the Event of a Leave of Absence,
Termination, or Death**

::: {xmlns=""}
**8.4.1 Leave of Absence**
:::

With pay \
If the academic specialist\'s pay is being continued (e.g., if the leave
is a medical leave), the normal premiums will continue to be deducted
and the University will make its normal contribution toward the cost of
the health, dental, and retirement programs. \
\
Without pay \
Academic specialists granted an approved leave of absence without pay
may continue in force the optional benefit programs by paying the full
cost of all premiums. The same University contribution toward the dental
premium continues for up to 24 months while on a leave of absence
without pay. The remaining optional coverages may be continued by making
cash payments for as long as the approved leave continues. Payments for
benefits to be kept in force should be made directly to Michigan State
University and sent to the Human Resources Office no later than the
first day of the month for which the payment is due. Benefits not
maintained will automatically be reinstated upon return to active
employment.

All deferrals and contributions to the retirement plan(s) are suspended
during the period of a Leave of Absence without pay.

An academic specialist on a Family Medical Leave (FMLA) will have their
health and dental benefits continued at the same level and with the same
premium contribution as prior to the FMLA leave. Any share of premiums
which had been paid by the individual prior to the leave must continue
to be paid during the leave, otherwise coverage will be cancelled.

Provisions are available to academic specialists on leave due to
acceptance of prestigious awards or fellowships for the continuation of
applicable University benefits. Additional information should be
requested from the Human Resources Office. (See Continuation of Benefits
While on Leave of Absence No Pay Status to Receive Prestigious Awards,
Fellowships and/or Special Assignment Opportunities.)

**8.4.2 Termination**

In case of termination, benefits will be affected as follows:

> 1.  Health, dental, basic and employee-paid life, and accidental death
>     and dismemberment coverages will continue in force until the end
>     of the month following the last deduction and/or contribution
>     made.
> 2.  Long-term disability and travel accident coverages cease on the
>     last day of active employment.
> 3.  Coverage under the dental and/or health plans may be continued in
>     accordance with the [Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act
>     (COBRA)](/benefits/cobra/index.html "COBRA info") of 1986 for up
>     to 18 months by paying a monthly premium (29 months if currently
>     disabled and receiving Social Security Disability (SSD) or deemed
>     disabled by SSD any time during the first 60 days of COBRA
>     coverage). Contact the Human Resources Office for details.
> 4.  Employee-paid coverage may be converted by contacting the company
>     directly.

**8.4.3 Death**

In addition to life benefit payments to beneficiaries, it is possible
for the surviving spouse and eligible dependents to continue health
and/or dental coverages by contacting the Human Resources office. The
University will contribute toward the health and dental premiums for the
surviving spouse or the OEI if the academic specialist was eligible for
retirement. The surviving spouse or OEI of a vested academic specialist
who is also an active employee in their own right may be eligible for
dual benefits as follows: \
\
Eligible for 100% dental coverage.

Eligible to retain deceased person\'s health plan benefits instead of
the health plan for which they are eligible as an active employee.\
