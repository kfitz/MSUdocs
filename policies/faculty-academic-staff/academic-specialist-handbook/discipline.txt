Academic Specialist Manual

**6.3 Discipline**

Disciplinary action short of dismissal for cause may be imposed after
the unit administrator has conferred with the dean/separately reporting
director and has provided the academic specialist with written notice of
the reason for disciplinary action and an opportunity to respond. Such
action may be imposed as a result of dismissal consideration or
independent of such consideration. The academic specialist shall be
informed of the right to file a grievance under the Faculty Grievance
Policy.\
