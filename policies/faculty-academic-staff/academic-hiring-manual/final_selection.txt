1.  As a general matter, salary offers are to be within the range
    stipulated in the CHR Approved Academic Position Request. A salary
    offer within 10% of the range stipulated on the CHR Academic
    Position Request may be made if approved by the Dean.\
    \
    Salary offers more than 10% above the range limits originally
    approved must be approved by the Provost\'s Office before the offer
    is made. Also, when the approved salary range has been stated as
    \"open\" or \"competitive\" the salary offer must be discussed and
    agreement reached with the Provost\'s Office before an offer is
    made. In either case, the Dean sends an e-mail to the Associate
    Provost/Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources to
    request approval.\
    \
2.  If rank exceeds the originally approved terms, the Dean has the
    following options:
    -   Request a waiver to hire the preferred candidate at the higher
        rank. If a waiver is not appropriate, the options are limited to
        the following options below
    -   Repost the position, since if the position had been posted at a
        higher rank originally, a different pool of applicants may have
        resulted.
    -   Select a different final candidate as the preferred candidate.

to make an offer for a position as Associate Professor with tenure.

        assigned duties and responsibilities. Although changes in your
        appointment status are not foreseen, in the event that either
        the Department\'s mission changes and/or your specific duties
        and responsibilities are modified so that an annual appointment

        Academic Year
        Basis.](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/basic_employment_commitment.html "AY Commitment")\")

    to degree verification. The offer letter must indicate \"The offer
    of appointment is contingent on satisfactory criminal background

    I-9, noting that an individual from the department will contact the
    person being appointed to initiate the I-9 process; (If it is known

the [Exposure to Health Risks / Physical Demands
form](https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/documents/HealthRiskPhysDemands.pdf "Health Risks/Physical Demands form") apply
