The hiring procedure for academic administrators follows, in general,
the Academic Hiring Procedure. There are special circumstances
associated with hiring administrators which are noted below.

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The procedures which are followed in selecting academic
    administrators must be in accordance with Department, College and
    University Bylaws, and University policy.
2.  When searching for a chairperson, the Dean plays the affirmative
    action role normally assigned to the Chairperson; when searching for
    a Dean, the Provost plays the affirmative action role normally
    assigned to the Dean in the academic hiring procedure.
3.  **Position Request and Search Plan**
    -   At a minimum, the search committee must have a tenure system or
        tenured (where possible) minority or woman on the search
        committee, whether by election or by appointment. It is the line
        administrator\'s responsibility to ensure that there is adequate
        representation on the search committee.
    -   As part of the CHR Approved Academic Position Request approval,
        the Dean(s) and the Provost approve either an external search or
        an internal search.
    -   For internal searches, on the Academic Hiring Availability Data
        & Recruitment Activities form the unit simply types in
        \"internal search\". The \"Search Committee Composition\"
        section on the CHR Approved Academic Position Request form is
        filled in, or if there are too many names to list (for example,
        when all tenure system faculty in the unit constitute the search
        committee) a description of the membership (for example, \"all
        tenure system faculty in the department, with Professor Joseph
        College acting as AA Advocate\") will suffice.
    -   A member of the staff of I3 may be asked to conduct the
        affirmative action review session with the search committee. To
        arrange such a session, call the Director/Senior Advisor for
        Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives, at 353-3922.
4.  **Advertising, Recruiting and Screening **\
    -   For external searches, positions may be advertised in
        institutional references such as the \"Chronicle for Higher
        Education\" as well as in other disciplinary/professional
        publications.
    -   For internal searches the unit fulfills all posting requirements
        by sending a notice to all unit faculty, including those jointly
        appointed with another unit, with qualifications as determined
        by the Chairperson clearly stated, and requesting that
        applications and nominations be submitted in writing along with
        vitae and any other documents the unit requires. Human Resources
        will post the vacancy on the Careers@MSU websites. \
        For internal searches the requirements for adequate
        representation in the applicant pool are limited to recruiting
        from within the unit. Unit bylaws may have specific procedures
        for identifying candidates. Such procedures must not conflict
        with the affirmative action, equal opportunity and diversity
        commitments of the University.
    -   Curriculum vitae for each final candidate may be forwarded to
        the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives in
        addition to the applicant list provided in PageUp.
5.  **Final Selection **\
    -   Final candidates for department chairperson/school director are
        interviewed by the Provost or designee as part of the regular
        interview process. Final candidates for Dean are interviewed by
        the President and the Provost as part of the regular interview
        process, in addition to other individuals designated in the
        approved search plan.
