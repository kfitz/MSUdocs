professor, librarian, or instructor, and academic staff have position
names such as academic specialist, coach, visiting scholar, consultant,
resident/intern, FRIB/NSCL engineer, FRIB/NSCL physicist, research
associate, lecturer, or assistant instructor; as well as titles such as 
assistant to dean, associate or assistant chairperson, associate or
assistant director, etc.; academic management administrative titles such
as dean, associate and assistant dean, chairperson, or school director,
etc.; and executive management titles such as president, provost,
associate provost, assistant provost, vice president, associate or

Those not covered by the academic hiring procedures are MSU Extension
employees and Postdoctoral Fellows.

<div>

1.  MSU Extension is an outreach agency which operates under a separate
    personnel system which includes special hiring guidelines. The
    affirmative action compliance program for MSUE staff is covered by
    the United States Department of Agriculture and not the Department
    of Labor but is consistent with the Academic Hiring Procedures.
2.  Postdoctoral Fellow appointments are based on fellowships paid
    through MSU and the recipients of such fellowships are not employees
    and so are not covered by the Academic Hiring Procedures. (However,
    Research Associates are employees and are covered by the Academic
    Hiring Procedures.)
