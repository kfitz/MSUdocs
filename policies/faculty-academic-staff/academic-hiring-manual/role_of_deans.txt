Academic Hiring Manual

**1.2 - Role of Deans & Separately Reporting Directors in Academic
Hiring Process**

The hiring procedure firmly establishes accountability of deans and
separately reporting directors to advance diversity via the recruitment
and retention of women and minority faculty and academic staff members.
Annually data will be provided by the Office of the Provost to deans and
separately reporting directors detailing hiring records for tenure
system faculty by college together with collegiate departmental/school
profiles of current tenure system representation and hiring
opportunities for the next three years. Hiring outcomes and evidence of
aggressive broad gage recruitment efforts will be discussed annually
with each dean/separately reporting director by the Provost in regular
planning discussions. Records of diversity achievement or
non-achievement will have an impact on resource allocation and merit
salary decisions.\
