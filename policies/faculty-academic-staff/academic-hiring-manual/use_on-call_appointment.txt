Academic Hiring Manual

**5.1 When to Use an On-Call Appointment/Reappointment**

::: {xmlns=""}
Academic on-call appointments/reappointments are provided for
individuals (with employee status) appointed on a short-term, fixed-term
basis for all **non-credit academic activities** where payment and
service may vary. In addition to the usual University-approved
position/ranks and titles, such as instructor, academic specialist for
curriculum development or outreach activities, advisor, etc. used for
academic appointments, the following position/ranks may be used for
on-call appointments: Interpreter, Program Presenter, Tutor.
:::

If an individual is to be appointed for a credit course, an on-call
appointment is not used; instead, the regular academic personnel hiring
procedures are required. See the \"[Academic Hiring
Procedure](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-hiring-manual/index.html "Academic Hiring Procedure")\"
and \"[Waiver of Academic Hiring
Procedure](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-hiring-manual/waivers_use.html "Waiver Procedure")\"
for information on the regular hiring procedures.

To determine whether an individual may be processed as an independent
contractor, see the [Manual of Business
Procedures](http://ctlr.msu.edu/COMBP/HTTOC.aspx "Controller's Office Manual of Business Procedures") and
the Independent Contractor Status - Determination and Documentation
form. Questions concerning independent contractor status should be
directed to the Accounts Payable Office (353-2011).
