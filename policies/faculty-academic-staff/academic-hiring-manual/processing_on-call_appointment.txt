Academic Hiring Manual

**5.2 Processing An On-Call Appointment**

::: {xmlns=""}
An academic hiring form must be filled out and be completely processed
(i.e., be approved by the Dean, and Human Resources, and be processed
into the HR/Payroll System) before Payroll can process payments. Thus it
is important to fill out the form and submit it for approval well in
advance of the period during which the work will be performed.
:::

Complete [Form
I-9](https://hr.msu.edu/ua/i9/index.html "I9 Information") Employment
Eligibility Verification form via electronic I-9 system, and conduct a
criminal background check.

Submit the hiring form and attach documents via workflow in the EBS
portal to the Chairperson.  From there the materials are electronically
routed successively to the Dean and Human Resources.\
