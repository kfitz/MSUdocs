**Academic Hiring Manual Executive Management Offer of Appointment
Checklist**

::: {xmlns=""}
The following items must be included in all letters of offer of an
executive management position. It is strongly recommended that draft
offer letters be reviewed by the Associate Provost and Associate Vice
President for Academic Human Resources.
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Appointment starting date, position title, salary rate,
    administrative increment (if any), summary of position
    responsibilities, and, if applicable, salary status in case of
    return to a regular faculty/staff position.
-   Notice that appointment is \"at will.\" E.g., Individuals holding
    Executive Management positions serve at the pleasure of the
    administrative superior to whom responsibility for personnel actions
    has been delegated and may be relieved from administrative
    responsibilities at any time without notice or cause. As applicable,
    an individual\'s tenured faculty status is not affected by this at
    will provision.
-   A criminal background check is a prerequisite for all executive
    management appointments (excluding foreign nationals who come to MSU
    directly from residence outside the U.S., for whom the Department of
    Homeland Security provides the necessary clearance) at Michigan
    State University. The offer letter must indicate: \"This offer of
    appointment is contingent on satisfactory criminal background check
    results, including degree verification. You will be contacted by
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to initiate the background check process.\"
-   Form I-9. Appointment approval is also subject to completion of a 
    USCIS I-9 form. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
    requires MSU to verify the employment eligibility and identity of
    all new hires via the I-9 form.
-   Vacation entitlement. E.g., Eligible for forty-eight (48) vacation
    days biennially on a fiscal year basis. Vacation days are available
    prospectively; they are non-accruable beyond the biennial fiscal
    year period. Vacation allowances are granted on July 1 of
    odd-numbered years. Proportional allowances are granted to
    individuals appointed during the biennial period.
-   Medical/sick leave. E.g., Up to six months of paid leave is
    available if health problems prevent the individual from working.
    Medical leave is non-accruable with no terminal payoff.
-   Benefits. E.g., Michigan State University provides Executive
    Managers with a variety of benefits, including retirement program,
    health, dental, and life coverages. The attached Summary of Benefits
    will provide you with a broad overview of the range of benefits
    available. You must enroll in benefit programs within 30 (thirty)
    days of your appointment beginning date.
-   Retirement eligibility. E.g., To be considered a retiree from
    Michigan State University, an individual must have attained one of
    the following:  1) 15 years of service in an Executive Management
    position; 2) at least age 62 with a minimum of 15 years of
    University service; 3) 25 years of service at any age. If the
    condition of \#1, above, is met, the individual retains eligibility
    for Michigan State University retiree status if assigned
    subsequently to a non-Executive Management position.
:::

For individuals who transfer from another MSU position:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Sick leave payoff: A support staff employee may choose to have 50%
    of the accrued sick leave paid at the time of transfer at the
    current salary rate or it may be paid at the time of retirement at
    the salary rate in effect then. The offer letter should confirm the
    desired option.
-   Official Retirement Status: An individual entering executive
    management status from an MSU position in which service credits
    toward retirement status have been earned shall be given immediate
    credit toward the fifteen year Executive Management retirement
    requirement in proportion to the ratio that such prior service bears
    to the 25 year service requirement for all other University
    employees, rounded up to the next half year. The offer letter should
    confirm the application of this provision.
