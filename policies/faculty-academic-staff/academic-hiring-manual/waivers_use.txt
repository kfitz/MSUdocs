Occasionally a unit may need assistance from the Provost\'s Office to
fund a waiver appointment. Questions concerning such funding or
concerning approval for a continuing position which involves a waiver
should be directed to the Provost. Other questions, including the
appropriate use of waivers should be addressed to the Associate
Provost/VP for Academic Human Resources.

    the Associate Provost/VP for Academic Human Resources for further
