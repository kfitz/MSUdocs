Academic Hiring Manual

**2.3 Advertising, Recruiting, and Screening**

1.  All academic vacancies must be posted locally. Tenure system
    positions must be advertised nationally. Other continuing
    appointment system positions must be advertised nationally or within
    the geographical area customary for the appointment. The application
    deadline date for all postings must be at least two weeks after the
    posting date but preferably longer. Allow ample time (usually at
    least one month, preferably longer) for the period between posting
    and hiring.
    -   Human Resources fulfills the obligation to post locally.
    -   For all other advertising of Provost-approved positions,
        including additional local advertising or national or
        international advertising, the unit may deal directly with
        publications, associations, etc., or may send a purchase
        requisition for advertising and a copy of the advertisement to
        the Purchasing Department. All advertisements must conform to
        the requirements listed on the CHR Approved Academic Position
        Request form. 
2.  During the two-year period of position approval, postings need to
    appear only once unless there is a specific unit need to request a
    repost. In such cases, call or e-mail Human Resources to request a
    reposting.
3.  Search committee chairperson acknowledges all communications from
    applicants and from others who suggest candidates. Search committee
    makes good faith efforts to ensure representation at or above
    current availability percentages for women and minority groups.
    Gender and race/ethnicity may be identified while networking to
    recruit candidates, or as a best guess based on membership in
    professional associations, the source of applicants, etc.
4.  The Chairperson has the primary responsibility as an individual to
    ensure adequate representation based on current availability
    percentages of women and minority groups among the initial
    applicants and in the candidates remaining after each screening
    process.
5.  The search committee screens all candidates on the basis of (1)
    programmatic need, (2) excellence of qualifications and credentials
    based on clearly delineated job-related criteria, (3) placement
    goals and (4) diversity considerations. Search committee recommends
    a list of final (on-campus interview) candidates.
6.  The Chairperson and Dean sequentially approve both the initial
    applicant list and later the list of final (on-campus interview)
    candidates. The final list of applicants, including potential
    alternates, must be listed on the [Academic Final Interview
    Form](https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/documents/Academic_Interview_List_Approval_Form.pdf "Academic Final Interview Form"),
    with Chairperson and Dean signatures. This is uploaded to the PageUp
    system. The list of applicants with those denoted for interviews, as
    well as potential alternates, is sent to the Office of Inclusion and
    Intercultural Initiatives (I3) via the PageUp applicant tracking
    system for approval of the diversity of the final candidate list. If
    I3 determines that the diversity of the final candidate list is
    inadequate, the search committee is directed to undertake additional
    efforts to obtain adequate representation, and the list of
    applicants with those denoted for interviews is revised and again
    submitted for approval. This process continues until the final
    candidate list has been approved by I3.\
    The search committee must not contact final candidates to set up
    interviews, and must not send any letters of rejection until after
    I3 approves the final candidate list via the applicant tracking
    system.
