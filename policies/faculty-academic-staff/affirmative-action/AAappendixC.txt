**Appendix C. Checklist of Search Committee Activities - Affirmative
Action Handbook**

::: {xmlns=""}
Search committee activities will vary from department to department,
from college to college, and depending on the type of position to be
filled, even from search to search. The following checklist includes
required aspects of searches as well as items which may be appropriate
for some searches but not all. (Required elements of searches are set
forth in the \"[Academic Hiring
Manual](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/academic-hiring-manual/index.html "Academic Hiring Manual")\").
Some activities listed below may be done by the unit administrator
rather than the search committee in some units. Some of the activities
may be done in a different order, and various units may have additional
activities such as input from other unit committees at various stages in
the process. In order for a list such as this to be of maximum benefit
to search committees the unit must customize it to fit its own way of
conducting searches.
:::

**Unit administrator meets with the search committee and delivers the
charge**. Search committee members must have a clear understanding of
the charge including:

\[ \] Unit administrator\'s vision for the position and the necessary
qualifications;

\[ \] Scope of authority: what tasks and decisions will be the
responsibility of the committee;

\[ \] General timelines for completion of search committee activities;

\[ \] Documentation requirements (see [Documenting the
Search](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/documenting_search.html)).

**Unit administrator conducts an affirmative action review session with
the committee**. Members must have a clear understanding of the
following:

\[ \] The unit\'s affirmative action profile in terms of women, total
minorities, Blacks, Asians, Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders,
Hispanics, and American Indians and Alaskan Natives, including:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Current representation of members of these groups on the unit\'s
    faculty;
-   Availability of members of these groups;
-   Unit hiring goals, if any.
:::

\[ \] The University\'s commitment to affirmative action, equal
opportunity and diversity. \
\[ \] The committee members should have a copy of the \"[Handbook for
Faculty Searches with Special Reference to Affirmative
Action](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/index.html)\".

\[ \] The committee members should be provided with a copy of the two
forms the unit must complete as part of the search process, the CHR
Approved Academic Position Request form (located in the EBS portal) and
the [Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment
Activities](https://www.hr.msu.edu/aaremoved.html "Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment Activities").

**Search committee commences activities**

\[ \] Elect a search committee chairperson and delineate his/her
responsibilities.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   all committee correspondence should be in the name of the search
    committee chairperson.
:::

\[ \] Elect a member of the search committee as the affirmative action
advocate and delineate his/her responsibilities. The affirmative action
advocate shall evaluate the search on an ongoing basis, in terms of the
goals and principles of affirmative action and bring deficiencies to the
attention of the search committee (or as necessary to the attention of
the unit administrator) for corrective action, including but not limited
to:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   discriminatory bias, prejudice or stereotyping in communications,
    including but not limited to committee discussions, written
    communications, and interview questions
-   inadequate/ineffective search strategies for identifying qualified
    individuals of underutilized groups, and soliciting applications
    from such individuals
-   inadequate representation of underutilized groups in applicant or
    candidate pools
-   discriminatory bias, prejudice or stereotyping in criteria for the
    evaluation of applicants\' materials and candidates\' interviews
-   little or no weight given to affirmative action goals as a factor in
    the decision making process
:::

\[ \] Each search committee member shares their vision of the position,
and any conflicting opinions concerning the nature of the position and
the required qualifications are resolved.\
\
\[ \] Write position description, making sure it is not so restrictive
as to needlessly limit the pool of applicants.

\[ \] Write position advertisement and determine the application due
date.

\[ \] Complete the CHR Approved Academic Position Request form including
the position advertisement.

\[ \] Establish a search plan including all the strategies which will be
followed in locating and contacting potential applicants.

\[ \] Complete the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment
Activities form, and the Search Committee Composition located within the
CHR Approved Position Request form. If the search committee composition
changes at any time after this, send an email to the Office for
Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives (I3) via the unit administrator
and the Dean.

Once the department chairperson/school director has approved the CHR
Approved Academic Position Request and the Academic Hiring Availability
Data & Recruitment Activities form, they are electronically routed for
approval to the Dean, the Provost and the Office of Inclusion and
Intercultural Initiatives (I3) for approval. The approval process may
take as long as three weeks and sometimes longer. The application due
date may need to be revised depending on how long position approval
takes. The search committee can continue getting organized and drafting
the various letters which will be needed, but the position may not be
advertised nor any other searching or recruiting initiated until after
the Provost has approved the position.

\[ \] If I3 indicates there is a need for a more extensive search than
was indicated on the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment
Activities form, revise the search strategies in accordance with I3
comments, and redo the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment
Activities form. The unit administrator will again submit the report for
I3 approval. This process is repeated until I3 approves the form.

\[ \] Set deadlines for close of nominations, close of application,
screenings, interviews, and final selection.

\[ \] Set a schedule of search committee meeting times and places.

\[ \] Establish the procedures the committee will follow, including:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   what constitutes a quorum and what is the penalty for missing an
    excessive number of meetings
-   who maintains the records of search proceedings, and how and where
    will they be kept during the search process
-   where applications and search documentation will be kept
-   how incomplete applications will be handled
-   how screening decisions will be documented
-   how reference checks will be handled
-   how information received by telephone will be documented
:::

\[ \] Write sample correspondence to be used in the various phases of
the search.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   letter soliciting nominations
-   letter acknowledging nominations
-   letter soliciting application
-   letter detailing materials applicant should submit (if not included
    in advertisement)
-   letter acknowledging receipt of applicant\'s materials
-   letter informing those who do not meet minimal qualifications
-   letter requesting a reference, or list of questions for telephone
    interviews of references
-   letter informing those not on the final candidate list
-   letter with further information for final candidates
-   letter informing those on the final candidate list who are not
    selected
:::

\[ \] Establish written job-related criteria for evaluation and
selection of candidates, being certain to include the ability of a
candidate to add intellectual diversity and cultural richness to a unit.
Determine the number of screenings which will be performed and the
specific criteria for each level of screening. Typically the first
screening, for example, will be for minimal qualifications such as
highest degree. Determine at which level references will be checked. \
\
\[ \] Develop plans for the campus visit,

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Write a patterned interview for final candidates (Review the
    questions you may and may not ask.).
-   Establish the activities to be included in final candidates\' campus
    visit.
:::

**After position is approved: **\
\
\[ \] Advertise the position and conduct all the other search and
recruiting activities indicated on the Academic Hiring Availability Data
& Recruitment Activities form.

\[ \] When applications have been received, check the diversity of the
pool against the availability data shown in the Academic Hiring
Availability Data & Recruitment Activities form. The gender and
race/ethnicity of all applicants may not be known, but if affirmative
efforts have been made the search committee will be able to identify
some race/ethnicity in a good-faith manner from personal contacts,
networking, source of applicants, membership in professional
associations, etc. If underutilized groups are not represented in the
applicant pool in proportion to availability, revisit the search plan
and make additional efforts to create a diverse pool. If there seems to
be no way to increase representation of underutilized groups in the
pool, contact campus resources to see if they can help. (See
\"[Affirmative Action
Resources](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/resources.html "Resources")\".
Revise Part B. Search and Recruitment Activities of the Academic Hiring
Availability Data & Recruitment Activities form whenever additional
activities are undertaken.

\[ \] Obtain unit administrator\'s approval of the pool of applicants
via approval in COMPASS. If approval is not given, reassess the search
strategies to find ways to correct deficiencies. (Unit administrator
will obtain Dean\'s approval).

\[ \] Send letter acknowledging receipt of materials to applicants,
along with a description of the search process and timeline, and
descriptive material about your unit.

\[ \] Evaluate candidates holistically in terms of the academic and
affirmative action needs of your unit, using the job-related criteria
and procedures established previously by the search committee.

\[ \] Follow the screening procedures established previously by the
committee. After each screening, give the unit administrator a list of
those to be dropped from further screening. Provide numerical summaries
of the gender/ethnic id of 1) all those who will be off the list, and 2)
those remaining on the list. Maintain documentation of reasons for
dropping applicants from further screening.

\[ \] Obtain unit administrator\'s approval of the list of applicants to
be eliminated from further consideration after each screening.

\[ \] Check applicants\' references.

\[ \] Select final (on-campus interview) candidates and maintain
documentation supporting the selection.

\[ \] Identify the final candidates in COMPASS.

\[ \] Obtain unit administrator\'s approval of the finalists.

The list of final candidates will be denoted in COMPASS for Dean and I3
approval.  If there is disapproval at any point, take the necessary
steps to correct the problem and revise accordingly. Once I3 has
approved the initial applicant and final candidate list, approval is
documented within the COMPASS system.  This process may take a week or
two. The committee can refine its plans for the interviews during this
time.

\[ \] Select an individual to handle travel arrangements and itinerary
for candidates who are to visit the campus.

\[ \] Review the questions you may and may not ask at interviews.

\[ \] Identify individuals you wish candidates to meet who are not on
the search committee.

**After the final candidate pool has been approved by I3:**

\[ \] Send letters to candidates who do not meet minimal criteria.

\[ \] Finalize plans for the campus visits.

\[ \] Send finalists additional printed information on the unit, college
and University.

\[ \] Conduct patterned interviews for all final candidates.

\[ \] If possible, have candidates teach a class or present a seminar.

\[ \] Candidates meet with interested groups.

\[ \] Candidates are interviewed by the unit administrator.

\[ \] Present unit administrator with the following:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   A listing of final candidates
-   documentation of special efforts to include women and minorities in
    all phases of the selection process, in addition to efforts already
    listed on the Academic Hiring Availability Data & Recruitment
    Activities form.
-   a resume or curriculum vitae for each final candidate
-   search committee\'s evaluation of final candidates (See \"[Sample
    Search Committee
    Report](/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/sample_report.html "Sample Search Committee Report")\"
    assessments made by individuals and/or groups who interviewed the
    final candidates
-   for each applicant who is not on the final candidate list, specific
    job-related reason(s) along with supporting documentation
-   applicant files including letter of application/nomination,
    curriculum vitae, reference letters, etc.
-   a file of the search committees procedures including copies of
    sample letters, screening criteria, core questions asked in the
    interview, meeting minutes if kept, etc.
:::

Unit administrator sends letter of offer, reflecting the guidelines
established by the Office of the Provost, and secures a letter from the
selected candidate that he or she accepts the position. If the preferred
candidate rejects the offer, the unit administrator offers the position
to the next final candidate denoted in COMPASS, and so on. If none of
the final candidates accept the job, the search committee goes back to
the applicants who met the minimum criteria and determines whether a new
list of final candidates can be selected. If so, the final candidate
list must again be approved by the Dean and I3 and the process continues
from there. If not, the unit may declare a failed search and start the
process all over again.

**After a candidate has accepted the position:**

\[ \] Consider whether Office of the Provost support for a portion of
the salary should be requested for an outstanding woman or minority not
offered the position. (Secure approval from the Office of the Provost
before notifying the second candidate).

\[ \] Notify the remaining applicants who were not on the final
candidate list.

\[ \] Notify the final candidates who were not selected.

\[ \] Be prepared to offer assistance for a spouse desiring employment.

\[ \] Send informational material on the Lansing area provided by local
realty firms, Chamber of Commerce and community organizations.

\[ \] Maintain records of the search process for three years after the
date of appointment. These records include all the materials provided by
the search committee with their final evaluations of final candidates.
If more than one candidate is offered the position and the initial
salary offers were different, the reason(s) for the difference must be
documented within the COMPASS system and added to the records which are
kept for three years.\
