**11.5 Minority Advisory Council - Affirmative Action Handbook**

::: {xmlns=""}
The Minority Advisory Council is a Board-established committee that is
responsible to the President for advising on University policies,
programs and procedures particularly affecting minority members of the
University community. In exercising this broad responsibility, the
Council has the specific charge to study and evaluate the efficacy of
University programs, policies and procedures as they affect members of
minority groups; identify areas in which new policies, programs and/or
procedures are needed to assure that such persons have full freedom of
educational and employment opportunity within the University; and to
assist in monitoring the effectiveness of the University\'s Affirmative
Action Program.\
