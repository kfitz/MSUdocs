Dear Dr.     :
:::

On behalf of the faculty in the Department of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and the
College of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I am pleased to recommend to the
administration at Michigan State University that we extend to you a full
time appointment in the tenure system as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the
Department of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to be effective \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
The appointment will be on an academic year (nine months) basis with the
salary paid in ten installments on the last working day of each month
during the academic year duty period (August 16 -- May 15). The salary
rate for the initial academic year will be \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  Following
the initial year, annual merit based salary adjustments are normally
effective on the first day of October. Faculty members appointed on an
academic year basis are to be available for university duties from
August 16 through May 15.  *(See note \#1 at end of letter for AN
appointments)*.

A criminal background check is a prerequisite for all faculty at
Michigan State University. This offer of appointment is contingent on
satisfactory criminal background check results, including degree
verification. You will be contacted by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to initiate
the background check process. *(See note \#2 at end of letter for
foreign nationals who come to MSU directly from residence outside the
U.S., for whom the Department of Homeland Security provides the
necessary clearance)*

 *(Include the following for **all **foreign nationals)* This offer is
also contingent on your securing valid immigration status and work
authorization before your expected start date and maintaining your valid
immigration status and work authorization throughout your employment.
For the limited purpose of compliance with federal export control
regulations, you may be required to provide information about your
citizenship status depending on the nature of your scholarly endeavors.
If subject to federal export control regulations, you may also be
required to maintain full-time employment status at MSU, confirm that
your permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the U.S.,
and sign a confidentiality agreement concerning transfer of certain
technical data.  

Assistant professors in the tenure system serve one four-year
probationary period, and receive a subsequent three-year probationary
period if the review for reappointment is positive.  *(See note \#3 at
end of letter)*. The complete commentary regarding the appointment,
reappointment, promotion and tenure process is in the [tenure system
policies
section](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/4Section-HR-Policies.html) of

*NOTES:*

1.  Substitute for annual (AN) appointments: This appointment will be on
    an annual year (12 month) basis with the salary paid in twelve
    installments on the last working day of each month. The salary for
    the initial year will be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Following the initial year,
    annual merit based salary adjustments are normally effective on the
    first day of October. Although your appointment is on an annual year
    basis, the University's basic appointment commitment is to an
    academic year (9-month) appointment. Your annual appointment is
    justified by the mission of the Department and your specific duties
    and responsibilities. Although changes in your appointment status
    are not foreseen, in the event that either the Department's mission
    changes and/or your specific duties and responsibilities are
    modified so that an annual appointment is not appropriate, your
    appointment status will revert to an academic year appointment.

2.  Substitute for foreign nationals who come to MSU directly from
    residence outside the U.S., for whom the Department of Homeland
    Security provides the necessary clearance: Degree verification is a
    prerequisite for all faculty appointments at Michigan State

    degree verification. You will be contacted by

        normal probationary period is four years.  Prior approval by the
        Provost is required for probationary period of two, three and

        individuals appointed at the rank of associate professor without

        prior to the conclusion of the stipulated probationary

        in the [tenure system policies
        section](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/4Section-HR-Policies.html) of
