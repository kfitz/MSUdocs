**7.3 Questions You May and May Not Ask of a Candidate - Affirmative
Action Searches**

Michigan Department of Civil Rights.)*

Interview questions must be job-related and should flow from the
elements of the position description. Questions should focus on a
candidate\'s abilities and professional experiences related to the
responsibilities of the open position. Care should be taken to avoid
asking inappropriate and unlawful personal questions at the interview.

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  You may not ask questions about race, color, national origin,
    religion, gender, sexual orientation, political persuasion, genetic
    information, disability, age or ancestry.
2.  You may not ask questions about marital status, (e.g., spouse\'s
    name, spouse\'s employment status, whether the candidate is single,
    married, divorced, separated, engaged or widowed), pregnancy,
    ability to reproduce, advocacy of any form of birth control, plans
    for a family or child care issues. You may inquire if the applicant
    has any commitments that would preclude her or him from satisfying
    job schedules. If such questions are asked, they must be asked of
    both genders.
3.  You may not ask questions about weight or height.
4.  You may not ask questions about one\'s state of health unless they
    are job-related. You may inquire about contagious or communicable
    diseases which may endanger others.
5.  You may not ask questions about physical condition.  You may ask a
    candidate if they can perform the essential functions of the job
    with or without accommodations.  
6.  You may not ask questions designed to discover one\'s age.
7.  You may not ask questions about a foreign address which would
    indicate national origin. You may, however, ask about the location
    and length of time of one\'s current residence.
8.  You may not ask questions concerning the candidate\'s place of birth
    or similar questions about the parents, grandparents and spouse of
    the candidate.
9.  You may not ask in a series of interviews for a given position
    questions of one gender and not of the other.
10. You may not ask if one is a U.S. citizen.  Proof of citizenship is
    part of the federal I-9 process which begins only after a
    conditional offer has been made to a candidate. You may not inquire
    if a candidate is native-born or naturalized.
11. You may not ask what is one\'s native tongue or how one\'s foreign
    language ability has been acquired. You may inquire into languages
    which the candidate speaks and writes fluently.
12. You may not ask about one\'s willingness to work on any particular
    religious holiday. You may ask about one\'s willingness to work a
    required work schedule.
13. You may not ask if a candidate has filed or has threatened to file
    discrimination charges.
14. You may not ask questions about any relative of a candidate which
    would be unlawful if asked of the candidate.
15. You may not ask questions about organizations that would reveal the
    race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status,
    national origin or ancestry of the applicant.  You may inquire about
    membership in job-related professional organizations (e.g., does an
    applicant for the position in an English department belong to the
    Modern Language Association?).
16. You may not ask about military service in the armed forces of any
    country except the U.S., nor may you inquire into one\'s type of
    discharge. You may ask if a candidate has served in the Armed Forces
    of the United States or in a State Militia.
17. You may not ask questions which would reveal arrests without
    convictions. You may ask if the candidate has been convicted of a
    crime and if any felony charges are pending against the candidate.
18. You may not ask questions about one\'s credit rating or request
    financial data.

Soon after the candidates are interviewed, the search committee should
meet to review the relative merits of each individual and to recommend
to the unit administrator the number of finalists specified in the
charge. The unit administrator responsible for the final decision may
wish to consult with the committee about the strengths and weaknesses of
the finalists before making a decision, or she/he may wish to explain to
the committee the rationale for the decision.\
