To help alleviate the cost of moving, a unit or college may pay moving
and related expenses up to \$10,000 with the recommendation and approval
of the unit administrator and the dean. This policy applies, of course,
only to individuals who are being employed by Michigan State University
for the first time and who are required to relocate from their residence
in another geographical area to the East Lansing/Lansing area.
Generally, a minimum of two estimates should be obtained for the moving
costs. The University will reimburse the individual on the basis of the
lowest estimate. Exceptions to the \$10,000 limit due to unusual
circumstances must be made in advance of the relocation and must be
approved by the unit administrator, the dean of the college and the
provost.
:::

The employee\'s unit must complete an \"[Employee Moving Expense
Information](http://ctlr.msu.edu/COMBP/mbp53EBS.aspx "Moving Expenses")\"
form (Exhibit 53-A), to report the amount of the reimbursement. Moving
expenses for household goods and personal items processed on a direct
payment voucher or on a reimbursement voucher will not have federal,
state or FICA taxes withheld. Since reimbursements for moving expenses
are reported as compensation and are not deductible on the Michigan
individual tax return, the employee should be advised to consider
adjusting his/her state tax withholding. (Sections 53.1 through 53.4 of
the Manual of Business Procedures should be utilized when processing
moving expenses.)

If a candidate you are attempting to recruit wishes to obtain an
overview of the housing market in central Michigan, there are a number
of realty firms that can provide this information, as well as give a
prospective buyer or renter a tour of East Lansing/Lansing and
surrounding communities. In addition, several firms can provide a search
committee or a prospective faculty member with a packet of descriptive
materials for acquainting an individual with East Lansing/Lansing. These
complimentary packets can be sent to the search committee or directly to
a prospective faculty member. 

Additional information about relocation is available from the [MSU
WorkLife Office](https://worklife.msu.edu/ "MSU WorkLife Office").\
