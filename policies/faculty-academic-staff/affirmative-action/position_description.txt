**3.2 The Position Description - Handbook for Faculty Searches with
Special Reference to Affirmative Action**

::: {xmlns=""}
The position description is initiated in the Academic Program Planning
and Review (APP&R or ASSPP&R) process, in discussions between the dean
and the unit administrator concerning program priorities and unit
staffing needs. Depending on the programmatic priorities of a unit, the
characteristics of an open position may be quite different from its
historical function. The position description is used to communicate the
unit administrator\'s vision for and justification of the open position.
The unit administrator may wish to solicit participation in developing
the position description from the unit\'s advisory committee, search
committee or other faculty bodies involved in the planning process.
:::

The Director of the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives
(303 Administration Building, 353-3922) and the Associate Provost and
Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources (422
Administration Building, 353-5300) are prepared to provide assistance in
writing a position description.\
