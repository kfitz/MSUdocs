**10. Support for Hiring Women, Minorities, and Persons with
Disabilities - Affirmative Action Handbook**

::: {xmlns=""}
An enhanced Faculty Recruitment Incentive Program provides funding
support and increased opportunities for continuous recruitment of
underrepresented group members through a partnership of the colleges and
the Office of the Provost. Elements of support for hiring minorities,
women and persons with disabilities include:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Continuous recruiting mode to allow units to recruit in broader
    areas of activity and/or in advance of projected retirements;
-   Continuous advertisement of positions in the tenure system at
    variable ranks, and as applicable, with broadly defined job
    descriptions to advance more flexible responses to recruitment
    opportunities. Units are encouraged to seek candidates from within
    academe and from non-traditional sources such as government and
    business;
-   The Office of the Provost will work in partnership with the colleges
    to provide transitional funding for underrepresented group members
    until future retirements occur.
-   The Office of the Provost will consider requests for special set-up
    funds for faculty from underrepresented groups.
-   In some cases a search committee will identify a woman, minority, or
    person with a disability as an outstanding candidate, but an offer
    is not extended to that individual because he or she is highly
    ranked but is placed behind another candidate because of specifics
    of program needs or other requirements. Or, a search committee may
    find two well-qualified women, minorities, or persons with
    disabilities for the same position. On a case by case basis, the
    Office of the Provost, through a partnership with the colleges, may
    provide some of the funding necessary to hire the second individual.
