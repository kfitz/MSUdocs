**6.1 Initial Stage - Affirmative Action Searches**

::: {xmlns=""}
Searches that drag on interminably have a frustrating and negative
effect on both the members of the committee and the candidates.
Timelines and deadlines should be established and followed. Before the
beginning of each semester, the committee should set an intensive
meeting schedule so they can complete their tasks in a timely manner. It
is easier to cancel some unnecessary meetings than it is to add extra
meetings after committee members have established their schedules for
the semester. Activities for which the search committee may wish to
establish dates and deadlines are:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   publication of the job description;
-   the close of nominations;
-   the close of applications;
-   when the committee will begin reading dossiers;
-   when the first screening will be made;
-   when interviews will take place, which may include visits to the
    campus;
-   when the final recommendations will be made.
:::

Each committee member should have an opportunity to state her or his
personal vision for this appointment. This type of discussion helps
foster understanding among the committee members. Concerns voiced by
committee members should be considered as they arise. Prompt and fair
resolutions of conflict among committee members will promote
cooperation. The committee should discuss and agree upon operational
ground rules such as the following:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   what types of committee business will be recorded ([see
    \"Documenting the
    Search](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/documenting_search.html "Documenting the Search")\");
-   what constitutes a quorum;
-   what is the penalty for a committee member who misses an excessive
    number of meetings;
-   what are the responsibilities of the committee chairperson.
    -   Will the chairperson, for instance, participate in the selection
        of the finalists, will she or he have a vote, will the
        chairperson select candidates to be interviewed independently of
        the committee?
    -   Generally, all communications from the search committee should
        come from the chairperson of the committee.
:::

The various types of letters to be sent from the search committee
(letters requesting the names of candidates, letters informing
individuals that they have been nominated, letters thanking nominators,
letters acknowledging receipt of applicant\'s materials) should be
developed early in the search process. It is useful to discuss how
records will be kept and where dossiers will be placed for committee
members to review. The committee may also want to create a checklist of
items that it wishes to receive from the applicant, so that the
individual may be contacted if anything is missing.

The selection criteria and screening procedures should also be
determined at this point and not after materials from the applicants
arrive. The qualifications applicants must possess and the standards for
judgment by the committee should be clearly understood and endorsed by
its members. The relative weight, for instance, given to publications,
teaching, service, community activities, letters of recommendation and
the ability to enhance cultural diversity and richness should be
thoroughly discussed at the start of the search process by the
committee. The committee must also determine how reference information
will be collected (e.g., letters, telephone calls, a combination of
both).

The unit administrator should keep in touch with the committee
chairperson or with the whole committee on a regular basis throughout
the search process.\
