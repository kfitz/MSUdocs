**11.3 Faculty Grievance Office - Affirmative Action Handbook**

::: {xmlns=""}
The [Faculty Grievance Official (FGO) (W38 Owen Hall,
353-8884](https://www.msu.edu/~fgo/ "Faculty Grievance Office")) is a
senior faculty member experienced in both the dynamics of human behavior
and academic governance. The FGO as a neutral party receives and
attempts to resolve disputes and misunderstandings between faculty and
administrators. As an advisor, facilitator and possible intermediary
between grievant and respondent, the FGO provides counsel regarding the
substance and merit of a grievance. The FGO and staff, with strict
confidentiality, advise in regard to appropriate procedures and
channels, and provide access to records and administrators while
guarding privacy of records and persons.
:::

The office maintains a private and comfortable environment which is open
year round. Staff are helpful by listening to concerns, identifying
appropriate resources and proposing options, to the extent one wishes,
toward informal dispute resolution.

Under the Faculty Grievance Policy, the FGO must process all complaints.
Should a complaint not be resolved informally, the FGO randomly selects
a panel of faculty peers, readying a process for formal proceedings,
findings and decisions. The Faculty Grievance Official works in harmony
with other administrative grievance structures within the University,
i.e., the Ombudsperson.\
