**05. Documenting the Search - Affirmative Action Searches**

::: {xmlns=""}
All units, colleges, and the University itself, must maintain records of
all individuals who apply for a position, who are hired for a position,
and who are rejected for a position. Records must be kept for at least
three years after the date of appointment, by mandate of the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). These must be kept so that
they will be available for review by the Office of Inclusion and
Intercultural Initiatives (OIII) and OFCCP. The search committee
determines how it will accomplish its record keeping responsibilities,
including who will maintain records of the search, as well as how and
where the records will be kept during the search.
:::

An academic unit must be able to demonstrate that it has made a \"good
faith\" effort to recruit women and minorities. Among the records that
must be retained to do this are the following:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Academic Position Request plus a copy of all advertisements used to
    announce the position;
-   Affirmative Action Report including:
    -   a listing of where the position was posted;
    -   an indication of the extent to which nominations were solicited
        from colleagues and professional organizations;
    -   a record of the efforts that were made to enlarge the pool of
        candidates;
    -   Demographic information on all members of the search committee
        (name, academic rank/title, ethnic identification, and gender)
-   copies of sample letters used in the process;
-   the core questions asked in the interview;
-   applicant file (letter of application/nomination, curriculum vitae,
    reference letters, etc.);
-   for each applicant who is not on the final list, specific
    job-related reason(s) along with supporting documentation
-   a summary evaluation for each final candidate. This may be
    accomplished by retaining rating sheets, interview evaluations,
    ranking summaries, or any document used in the evaluation process.
    The reasons must be concrete and directly related to the
    requirements of the position description (e.g., \"research and
    scholarly activities too limited\"; \"did not have five years of
    teaching experience\"; \"lacked experience in scenic design\";
    \"refused offer for personal reasons\"). See \"[Sample Search
    Committee
    Report.](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/sample_report.html "Sample Search Committee Report")\"
-   minutes of search committee meetings. These may be worth having
    particularly if a problem arises. The minutes should include all
    important committee decisions to help document consistent procedures
    and to prevent bias from tainting a search. Minutes are important in
    case of a discrimination suit to demonstrate that a committee
    followed its own rules consistently and treated all candidates
    fairly. These records must be retained by the unit for at least
    three years after the date of appointment.
:::

In compliance with federal rules and regulations, each unit of the
University is responsible for completing the Affirmative Action Report
for faculty and academic staff which documents the disposition of all
candidates considered for a position.\
