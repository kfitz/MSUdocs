**4.3 Charge to the Search Committee - Affirmative Action Searches**

::: {xmlns=""}
The charge from the unit administrator to the search committee must be
clear and precise; ambiguity in the charge, in the role of the
committee, or in the extent of the search committee\'s authority can
create confusion that will hamper and delay the selection process at
critical points. The unit administrator conducts an affirmative action
review session with the search committee, focusing on the University\'s
commitment to affirmative action and equal opportunity, and to a fair,
legal, and effective recruitment process which advances diversity and
excellence in the academic workforce.
:::

The following activities which must take place in every search are
usually the responsibility of the search committee, although in some
units some activities may be handled by the unit administrator or
others.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   become knowledgeable about the unit\'s affirmative action goals and
    timetables;
-   select an affirmative action advocate (of any gender or ethnic id);
-   conduct a search which is sensitive to affirmative action issues;
-   write the position description/advertisement for the Academic
    Position Request form;
-   create a search plan specific to the position;
-   establish position-related criteria and procedures for screening
    applicants;
-   draft recruitment letters;
-   collect the names and addresses of individuals and institutions to
    which recruitment letters should be sent;
-   recruit a diverse pool of applicants;
-   inform applicants about the search process including the degree of
    confidentiality of their applications;
-   report progress to the unit administrator;
-   review and evaluate all applicants, including reference checks and
    interviews for those under serious consideration (in some cases the
    unit administrator may wish to determine which candidates should be
    interviewed or brought to campus);
-   complete all necessary documentation for the search;
-   recommend to the unit administrator a specific number of candidates
    by a fixed date. The charge to the committee should specify whether
    the candidates are to be ranked, rated and/or evaluated by the
    committee.
:::

Any ambiguities in the charge should be clarified and the committee
should ask for changes which they believe are necessary. The search
committee should assess the issues facing its academic unit, including
considerations emanating from program review or other strategic planning
activities, and discuss the nature and requirements of the position to
be filled. Such assessment and discussion will, of course, assist the
committee in determining qualifications and characteristics to be sought
in a candidate. \
Part of the search committee\'s assessment should be a review of the
profile of its academic unit to determine what the affirmative action
needs are and how those needs will be addressed. Since a major element
in conducting an effective affirmative action search is to create a
large and diverse pool of applicants which includes substantial numbers
of women and minorities, it is essential for the committee to discuss
how the recruitment process will take place, where the job
advertisements will appear, and what strategies will be devised for
enlarging the pool of applicants. The committee should also discuss and
develop methods to remove bias, prejudice, and stereotyping at all
stages of the search. In addition, the chairperson of the committee
should become familiar with affirmative action procedures, as well as
with the mandatory affirmative action record keeping (see \"[Documenting
the
Search](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/documenting_search.html "Documenting the Search")\").

If assistance is needed, the committee chairperson is encouraged to
contact the Director of the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural
Initiatives (303 Administration Building, 353-3922) or the Associate
Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources (422
Administration Building, 353-5300). These individuals can advise a
search committee on how to conduct a search sensitive to affirmative
action issues, as well as suggest strategies for addressing specific
problems. They are available to the search committee as a resource and
advisor throughout the search process.

A summary checklist of search committee activities may be found in
Appendix C.\
