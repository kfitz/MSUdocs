**4.4 Writing the Position Description - Affirmative Action Searches**

::: {xmlns=""}
A specific and concrete position description will have several
beneficial effects: it forces the search committee to focus on exactly
what it desires in a candidate and to articulate its expectations; it
provides guidelines by which applicants will be evaluated; and it
encourages a self-selection process among potential applicants by
allowing them to screen themselves for consideration. A well-conceived
and well-written position description will also aid the search committee
at the interview stage. Since interview questions must be job-related
they should flow from the elements of the position description.
:::

While position descriptions may vary widely, descriptions of academic
positions which are submitted as part of the position approval process
must include the following elements:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   rank and/or title; \
    -   You may wish to remain flexible on the rank; e.g., \"associate
        or full professor\". A position request for a tenure system
        position at the rank of associate or full professor requires
        special justification.
-   department; \
    -   For an administrative or supervisory position, the office or
        individual to whom that position reports should be included.
-   appointment basis; i.e., academic year or annual year
-   appointment status; \
    -   e.g., tenure system, fixed term, continuing appointment system,
        fixed term but potentially tenure system
-   percent employment, if less than 100%;
-   description of duties;
-   specific qualifications such as degree, license and experience
    requirements;
-   areas of specialization if applicable;
:::

In developing a position description, it is beneficial to examine
closely the requirements that have been enumerated to be certain that
they are not simply the result of traditional practices but are genuine
job-related activities that are necessary to perform the required
duties. Rigid physical requirements, for instance, which are not
necessary for a position may exclude persons with disabilities from
applying.\
