**A. Special Arrangements/Commitments:**
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   laboratories and/or space;
-   equipment and operating expenses;
-   practice plan information.
-   moving expenses
    -   (example for moving expenses) The University (college or
        department) commits to cover reasonable moving expenses up to a
        maximum of \$10,000 (a specific amount could be included). You
        should be aware that, in accordance with federal tax law,
        payments or reimbursements for moving expenses of household
        goods and personal items are reportable as taxable income on
        Form W-2, but are not subject to income tax withholding. Tax
        withholding, however, is required for other kinds of moving
        expense reimbursements which will also be reported on Form W-2.
        Please see the Payroll Office
        [website](http://www.ctlr.msu.edu/COPayroll/movingexpenseinfo.aspx)
        for more information.

**B. Personalizing Comments: **Clearly, an important part of any letter
of offer are those comments that personalize the offer, provide
additional information that may have been requested by the individual,
and communicate a sense of enthusiasm regarding the unit\'s desire to
have the candidate join the Michigan State University faculty.

**C. Prior approval by the Office of the Provost is required for any
letter of offer containing one of the following:**

::: {xmlns=""}
-   granting a probationary period for associate professors that is not
    four years;
-   an appointment entailing the commitment of tenure as of the
    effective date of appointment for an associate professor.
-   an appointment entailing the commitment of continuing appointment
    status as of the effective date of appointment for a senior
    specialist.

To obtain prior approval from the Office of the Provost, unit
administrators should submit, through the dean, a proposed letter of
offer, a curriculum vitae and outside letters of reference.\
