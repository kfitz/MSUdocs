**4.5 Writing the Advertisement - Affirmative Action Searches**

::: {xmlns=""}
In addition to the position description, the following information is
part of posting/advertisements of positions:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   position begin date (optional);

-   salary range (optional);

    -   Salary information may be omitted, or phrases such as salary is
        \"competitive,\" \"commensurate with qualifications\" or
        \"commensurate with degree and experience\" can be used);

-   a brief description of Michigan State University (optional);

    -   request for curriculum vitae or resume, etc. (optional);

-   The credentials which each applicant is expected to submit (e.g.,
    curriculum vitae, publications, number and types of references) may
    be included in the position description or in a letter to be sent to
    applicants who apply for the position or who have been nominated.

-   request for references (optional);

-   the statement, \"Applicants who are not U.S. citizens or permanent
    residents must provide documentation evidencing employment
    authorization in the United States.\" (optional);

-   deadline for receipt of application;

    -   The stated deadline for the receipt of applications must be
        strictly followed. Usually, the postmark of the applicant\'s
        letter of application must precede or be the same as the
        deadline in the advertisement. Flexibility in posting can be
        achieved by referencing \"preferably by\" before the closing
        date. This provides for posting deadline flexibility while
        giving applicants a reasonably precise closing date; or the
        statement \"Late submissions will be considered if suitable
        candidates are not identified by the deadline,\" may be used.

-   name, address and telephone number of contact person at Michigan
    State University (usually the search committee chairperson);

-   the statement, \"Persons with disabilities have the right to request
    and receive reasonable accommodation\"

-   the statement, \"Michigan State University is an Affirmative
    Action/Equal Opportunity Employer,\" or \"Women and minorities are
    encouraged to apply.\"
:::

Naturally, nothing in the position posting/advertisement may be
discriminatory or restrict equal opportunity (e.g., \"applicants under
30 preferred,\" \"recent graduates preferred,\" \"applicants from the
Northeast preferred\"). \
It is preferable to publish or distribute position descriptions early in
the academic year so that hiring decisions may be made in sufficient
time to allow an individual to complete his or her institutional
responsibilities elsewhere, and make professional and personal plans. In
the case of dual career couples, this will allow the applicant\'s spouse
or significant other ample time to look for new employment (see \"[Dual
Career
Couples](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/dual_career.html "Dual Career Couples")\").

Before advertising the position or undertaking the search, the unit
administrator is responsible for ensuring that the Academic Position
Request has been approved by the Provost.\
