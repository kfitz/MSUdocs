Handbook for Faculty Searches with Special Reference to Affirmative Action {#handbook-for-faculty-searches-with-special-reference-to-affirmative-action xmlns=""}
==========================================================================

01. Introduction {#introduction xmlns=""}
----------------

The \"Handbook for Faculty Searches with Special Reference to
Affirmative Action,\" from Ohio State University, was adopted with
permission from The Ohio State University. Preparation of the OSU
handbook was coordinated by Dr. Thomas H. Burkhardt, Affirmative Action
Faculty Consultant, Department of Human Relations, and Professor,
Department of Agricultural Engineering.

More information about hiring procedures at Michigan State University
can be found in the Academic Hiring Manual.

A checklist of search committee activities is included in Appendix C.
This can be used as a step-by-step guide for search committees.

02. Preface - Handbook for Faculty Searches with Special Reference to Affirmative Action {#preface---handbook-for-faculty-searches-with-special-reference-to-affirmative-action xmlns=""}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
Since 1964 the federal government has passed legislation and issued
executive orders designed to achieve equality of employment, end
discrimination in hiring and remedy the effects of past discrimination.
Michigan State University has not only complied with these measures, but
has also frequently and in a variety of ways, demonstrated its
commitment to ameliorate the negative effects of discrimination and to
achieve the ideals of affirmative action. MSU prohibits discrimination
on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, national origin,
political persuasion, sexual orientation, marital status, disability,
height, weight, veteran status or age. While significant progress has
been made, MSU has not yet reached its goal of a heterogeneous faculty
and student body with substantial representation of women and
minorities.
:::

There are four groups of people who, in terms of federal guidelines, are
classified as racial/ethnic minorities: Blacks, Asians and Pacific
Islanders, Hispanics, and American Indians and Alaskan Natives. In
addition, women, Vietnam-Era Veterans and persons with disabilities are
designated as \"protected\" classes and are also the focus of
affirmative action/equal opportunity concerns.

Affirmative action should not be confused with passive compliance with
regulations, tokenism, or good intentions. It is, instead, a proactive
concept which implies initiating aggressive, vigorous, and systematic
activities to achieve equality and equity for all individuals. There is
no single activity at this University more essential to realizing MSU\'s
affirmative action goals than the selection of new faculty and academic
staff. Hiring women and minorities, it has been demonstrated, adds
cultural richness to an institution and enhances its vitality and
excellence by broadening instructional, curricular, and research
efforts. A diverse faculty also encourages greater pluralism in the
student body by attracting women and minorities, while their presence as
role models and their efforts at mentorship increase the retention and
development of students from protected groups.

Equity, educational, organizational and business reasons require MSU to
advance the diversity of its faculty/academic staff compliment. One must
be mindful that there are significant differences in the backgrounds,
perspectives, needs, and interests of individuals and that these
differences should be taken into account in evaluating the unique
qualities and contributions of each applicant. Furthermore, to achieve
the departmental and institutional goals of diversity and richness in
our faculty, we must make a commitment to diversity in hiring, not just
targeting one group at the expense of others.

The University Bylaws for Academic Governance (1975) defines a key role
for the chairpersons and unit directors (2.1.2.), (2.1.2.1.) and
provides for strong faculty involvement (2.1.2.1.), (2.1.3.), (2.2.1.),
(2.2.8.) in the search and selection process. Unit and college bylaws
may specify policies and procedures in addition, but must not contravene
the University Bylaws (2.2.1.). Responsibility for the recruitment,
retention, and development of faculty is fundamentally influenced by
faculty values and attitudes, because all of these activities are
undertaken by individual faculty and faculty committees. This handbook
is designed to assist in attracting and retaining women and minority
scholars and creating a diverse workforce at Michigan State University.
Our goal is to achieve a new spirit of welcome and collegiality that
will produce improved representation through a commitment to the
institutional benefits of diversity within our community.
