**Office of Contract and Grant Administration**

::: {xmlns=""}
**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR (*Cont.*)**
:::

Formal agreements by funding organizations to support research and
creative projects are normally made between the organization and the
University rather than with individual faculty. Fiscal administration of
gifts, grants and contracts is the responsibility of the [Office of
Contract and Grant
Administration](http://www.cga.msu.edu/ "CGA - contract & grant administration").
Pre-proposals and draft proposals should be cleared with this office
before contact is made with granting organizations to insure conformity
with University policies on overhead, costsharing and similar matters. A
proposal to be sent to a potential sponsor should be accompanied by a
combined Transmittal Sheet/Gift and Grant form, which signifies approval
by the relevant department chairperson(s), dean(s) and the Office of
Contract and Grant Administration. This form also facilitates formal
acceptance of the award by the Board of Trustees. When Contract and
Grants receives official notification of an award from a funding
organization, an account can be established for initiating the project.\
