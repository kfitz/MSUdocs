**Conflict Situations**

 Last updated: 3/20/1970

**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR *(Cont.)***

*Complementary to its policy with reference to \"[Outside Work for
Pay](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/outside_work_for-pay.html "Outside Work for Pay"),\"
on March 20, 1970, the Board of Trustees adopted the statement on
conflict situations published in December, 1964, as a joint statement by
the Council of the American Association of University Professors and the
American Council on Education entitled, \"On Preventing Conflicts of
Interest in Government-Sponsored Research at Universities.\" This
section is reprinted below.*

1.  <div>

    **FAVORING OF OUTSIDE INTEREST.** When a university staff member
    (administrator, faculty member, professional staff member, or
    employee) undertaking or engaging in Government-sponsored work has a
    significant financial interest in, or a consulting arrangement with,
    a private business concern, it is important to avoid actual or
    apparent conflicts of interest between the Government-sponsored
    university research obligations and the outside interests and other
    obligations. Situations in or from which conflicts of interest may
    arise are the:

    </div>

    -   Undertaking or orientation of the staff member\'s university
        research to serve the research or other needs of the private
        firm without disclosure of such undertaking or orientation to
        the university and to the sponsoring agency;
    -   Purchase of major equipment, instruments, materials, or other
        items for University research from the private firm in which the
        staff member has the interest without disclosure of such
        interest;
    -   Transmission to the private firm or other use for personal gain
        of Government-sponsored work products, results, materials,
        records, or information that are not made generally available.
        (This would not necessarily preclude appropriate licensing
        arrangements for inventions, or consulting on the basis of
        Government-sponsored research results where there is significant
        additional work by the staff member independent of the
        Government-sponsored research);
    -   Use for personal gain or other unauthorized use of privileged
        information acquired in connection with the staff member\'s
        Government-sponsored activities. (The term \"privileged
        information\" includes, but is not limited to, medical,
        personnel, or security records of individuals; anticipated
        material requirements or price actions; possible new sites for
        Government operations; and knowledge of forthcoming programs or
        of official announcements);
    -   Negotiation or influence upon the negotiation of contracts
        relating to the staff member\'s Government-sponsored research
        between the university and private organizations with which the
        staff member has consulting or other significant relationships,
    -   Acceptance of gratuities or special favors from private
        organizations with which the university does or may conduct
        business in connection with a Government-sponsored research
        project, or extension of gratuities or special favors to
        employees of the sponsoring Government agency, under
        circumstances which might reasonably be interpreted as an
        attempt to influence the recipients in the conduct of their
        duties.\
        \

2.  **DISTRIBUTION OF EFFORT.** There are competing demands on the
    energies of a faculty member (for example, research, teaching,
    committee work, outside consulting). The way in which the faculty
    member divides his/her effort among these various functions does not
    raise ethical questions unless the Government agency supporting the
    research is misled in its understanding of the amount of
    intellectual effort the faculty member is actually devoting to the
    research in question. A system of precise time accounting is
    incompatible with the inherent character of the work of a faculty
    member, since the various functions the faculty member performs are
    closely interrelated and do not conform to any meaningful division
    of a standard work week. On the other hand, if the research
    agreement contemplates that a staff member will devote a certain
    fraction of his/her effort to the Government-sponsored research, or
    the faculty member agrees to assume responsibility in relation to
    such research, a demonstrable relationship between the indicated
    effort or responsibility and the actual extent of the involvement is
    to be expected. Each university, therefore, should \-- through joint
    consultation of administration and faculty \-- develop procedures to
    assure that proposals are responsibly made and complied with.\
    \
3.  **CONSULTING FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR THEIR CONTRACTORS.** When
    the staff member engaged in Government-sponsored research also
    serves as a consultant to a Federal agency, the conduct is subject
    to the provisions of the Conflict of Interest Statutes (18 U.S.C.
    202-209 as amended) and the President\'s memorandum of May 2,
    1963 *Preventing Conflicts of Interest on the Part of Special
    Government Employees.* When the staff member consults for one or
    more Government contractors, or prospective contractors, in the same
    technical field as the research project, care must be taken to avoid
    giving advice that may be of questionable objectivity because of its
    possible bearing on other interests. In undertaking and performing
    consulting services, the staff member should make full disclosure of
    such interests to the university and to the contractor insofar as
    they may appear to relate to the work at the university for the
    contractor. Conflict of interest problems could arise, for example,
    in the participation of a staff member of the university in an
    evaluation for the Government agency or its contractor or some
    technical aspect of the work of another organization with which the
    staff member has a consulting or employment relationship or a
    significant financial interest, or in an evaluation of a competitor
    to such other organization.

**University Responsibility** \
\
Each university participating in Government-sponsored research should
make known to the sponsoring Government agencies:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   The steps it is taking to assure an understanding on the part of the
    university administration and staff members of the possible
    conflicts of interest or other problems that may develop in the
    foregoing types of situations, and
-   The organizational and administrative actions it has taken or is
    taking to avoid such problems, including: \
    -   Accounting procedures to be used to assure that Government funds
        are expended for the purposes for which they have been provided,
        and that all services which are required in return for these
        funds are supplied;
    -   Procedures that enable it to be aware of the outside
        professional work of staff members participating in
        Government-sponsored research, if such outside work relates in
        any way to the Government-sponsored research;
    -   The formulation of standards to guide the individual university
        staff members in governing their conduct in relation to outside
        interests that might raise questions of conflicts of interest;
        and
    -   The provision within the university of an informed source of
        advice and guidance to its staff members for advance
        consultation on questions they wish to raise concerning the
        problems that may or do develop as a result of their outside
        financial or consulting interests, as they relate to their
        participation in Government-sponsored university research. The
        university may wish to discuss such problems with the
        contracting officer or other appropriate Government official in
        those cases that appear to raise questions regarding conflicts
        of interest.

The above process of disclosure and consultation is the obligation
assumed by the university when it accepts Government funds for research.
The process must, of course, be carried out in a manner that does not
infringe on the legitimate freedoms and flexibility of action of the
university and its staff members that have traditionally characterized a
university. It is desirable that standards and procedures of the kind
discussed be formulated and administered by members of the university
community themselves, through their joint initiative and responsibility,
for it is they who are the best judges of the conditions which can most
effectively stimulate the search for knowledge and preserve the
requirements of academic freedom. Experience indicates that such
standards and procedures should be developed and specified by joint
administrative-faculty action.\
