**Appointment Basis**

 Last updated: 7/15/2016

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES**

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on February
17, 1944 and amended on July 26, 1991.*

All academic personnel are appointed on either an academic year (AY) or
annual year (AN) basis. An academic year appointment covers a full
twelve month period with a nine-month assignment of duties and
responsibilities, including related departmental meetings before
registration in the fall and commencement and grade-reporting in the
spring. The assignment period will normally be from August 16 through
May 15 of the following calendar year. The two-week period preceding
classes will be an orientation/planning time.

An annual appointment is for a full-year assignment of duties and
responsibilities including periods of annual leave and paid holidays.

For AY appointments, the salary is paid on the last working day of each
month during the duty period, August 16 through May 15; for AN
appointments, the salary is paid on the last working day of each month.\
