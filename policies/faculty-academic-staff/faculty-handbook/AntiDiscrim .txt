**Anti-Discrimination Policy**

 Last updated: 10/30/2015

**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**\
*\
The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on April 9,
1993 and revised on December 5, 2003, April 13, 2007, and October 30,
2015.**\
\
*** **Article I. Purpose**

Michigan State University's scholarly community-building efforts occur
within the context of general societal expectations, as embodied in the
law.  The University, consistent with its policies and governing law,
promotes institutional diversity and pluralism through mechanisms such
as affirmative action, within an over-arching strategy promoting
equitable access to opportunity.  The University's commitment to
non-discrimination is the foundation for such efforts.

**Article II.** **Applicability**

This policy states expectations for institutional and individual
conduct. It applies to all University community members, including
faculty, staff, students, registered student organizations, student
governing bodies, and the University\'s administrative units, and to the
University\'s contractors in the execution of their University contracts
or engagements,^1 ^with respect to the following:

1.  All educational, employment, cultural, and social activities
    occurring on the University campus;
2.  University-sponsored programs occurring off-campus, including but
    not limited to cooperative extension, intercollegiate athletics,
    lifelong education, and any regularly scheduled classes;
3.  University housing; and
4.  Programs and activities sponsored by student governing bodies,
    including their constituent groups, and by registered student
    organizations.

**Article III.  Prohibited Discrimination**

Unlawful acts of discrimination or harassment are prohibited.

In addition, the University community holds itself to certain standards
of conduct more stringent than those mandated by law. Thus, even if not
illegal, acts are prohibited under this policy if they^2 ^:

1.  Discriminate against any University community member(s) through
    inappropriate limitation^3^ ** **of employment opportunity^4 ^,
    access to University residential facilities, or participation in
    educational, athletic, social, cultural, or other University
    activities on the basis of age, color, gender, gender identity^5^ ,
    disability status, height, marital status, national origin,
    political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran
    status, or weight; or
2.  Harass any University community member(s) on the basis of age,
    color, gender, gender identity, disability status, height, marital
    status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion,
    sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight.

These prohibitions are not intended to abridge University community
members\' rights of free expression or other civil rights.

**Article IV. Informal Resolution**

Informal resolution of disputes, through consultation provided by
offices serving the University, is encouraged.^6^ Informal resolution is
typically used when a claimant asks to participate in an informal
resolution, requests anonymity, does not consent to participation in an
investigation, or the alleged conduct, even if it does not rise to the
level of a policy violation, suggests the need for remedial,
educational, or preventive action.  Participation in informal resolution
is voluntary, and either party may terminate the informal resolution
process at any time.  If a party terminates attempts at informal
resolution, or the parties are unable to resolve the matter informally,
a formal review of the complaint will begin.^7 \
^

**Article V.  Complaints and Investigations**

Complaints under this Policy are processed and investigated by the
Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) pursuant to the OIE Complaint
Procedures.  Allegations involving gender discrimination, including
sexual and gender-based harassment, assault, and violence, are processed
and investigated pursuant to the Relationship Violence & Sexual
Misconduct (RVSM) Policy.

the locations, programs, and activities listed in Article II above.  The
University also investigates complaints of conduct occurring off-campus,
even if not occurring in the context of a University program or
activity, if the alleged conduct creates or contributes to a hostile
environment on campus.

the applicable student conduct or employee disciplinary process. 
Discipline may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal
for students or employees.
