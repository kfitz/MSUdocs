 Last updated: 11/19/1993

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

**LEAVES OF ABSENCE *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on May 25,
1956 and revised on November 19, 1993.*

**General Policy**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  A sabbatical  leave  is  intended for  the  mutual   benefit  of 
    the  University  and  the  faculty  member granted a leave.  The 
    purpose  is  to  encourage  academic and institutional
    revitalization by providing sustained time for  research/creative 
    activities;  development  of  new  courses  or  programs;acquisition
    of expanded and/or new qualifications and skills; contribution to
    academic unit plans to improve and/or refocus instructional,
    research, or public service activities in accordance with the
    mission of the University.
2.  A sabbatical leave is not granted automatically. Each request for a
    sabbatical leave must include a detailed description outlining the
    purposes, objectives and scholarly and research activities of the
    leave and normally should be submitted six months in advance of the
    starting date of the leave. The plan should indicate how the
    objectives and accomplishments of the leave will advance the
    interests and capabilities of the faculty member for fulfilling the
    aims, objectives and goals of the department/school, college or
    University.  All leaves must have the approval of the appropriate
    administrators and of the Provost or designee.
3.  Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of a sabbatical
    leave, a sabbatical leave report, with a separate summary not to
    exceed one page in length, must be submitted to the department
    chairperson/school director or dean of a non-departmentally
    organized college.  The report should include an assessment and
    evaluation of the leave accomplishments in relation to the
    sabbatical leave plan.  Departments/schools and non-departmentally
    organized colleges should retain a copy of the sabbatical leave
    report in applicable unit files.

**Eligibility**

1.  Only faculty members with tenure shall be eligible for sabbatical
    leaves.
2.  A sabbatical leave shall not be granted until the faculty member has
    completed six years of service to the University.  Service shall be
    interpreted to include those activities of interest to and supported
    by the University, regardless of the source of financial support.
3.  Years of service shall count from the date of full-time appointment,
    or from the ending date of the previous sabbatical leave (except as
    stated in the following section, number 3, below). However, all
    leaves of absence shall be excluded in determining years of service
    for a sabbatical leave.
4.  The length of leaves shall not be extended on the basis of more than
    six years of service since the previously compensated leave.
5.  Appropriate applications for a full year of leave (with reduced pay)
    normally have precedence over shorter term leaves (with full pay).

**Types of Sabbatical Leaves**

1.  For faculty on academic year appointments, sabbatical leaves are of
    two types:
    -   One term with no reduction in pay.
    -   Two terms with a fifty percent reduction in the academic year
        salary. (Payments distributed over the duty period.)
2.  For faculty on annual appointments:
    -   Up to six months with no reduction in pay.
    -   Twelve months with a fifty percent reduction in pay.
3.  For deans, directors, departmental chairpersons, and other
    administrative officers:
    -   Three months once in every three years with full pay, initially
        after six years of service to the University which includes at
        least three years of administrative service.
    -   Six months with no reduction in pay after at least six years of
        service to the University since the previous sabbatical or from
        the date of full-time appointment including at least three years
        in administrative positions without compensated leaves.
    -   Sabbatical leave eligibility following the return to regular
        faculty duties requires six years of service to the University
        since the completion of the sabbatical leave referenced in a.
        and b., above. Up to three years credit for service between the
        date of full-time employment or the end date of the sabbatical
        leave immediately preceding the administrative assignment,
        whichever is later, and the beginning date  of the
        administrative position may be applied toward this requirement
        only if the last sabbatical leave as an administrator was a
        three-month leave (see section 3a, above).

**Conditions**

1.  Recipients of sabbatical leaves are permitted to receive money for
    activities approved as part of the approved sabbatical plan without
    prejudice to their receipt of income from Michigan State University,
    provided that the total remuneration from all sources does not
    exceed that received from this institution.  (Financial support to
    offset the costs of travel and subsistence are excluded from total
    remuneration; see 3, below.)
2.  Teaching, research and service activities performed during
    sabbatical leaves must be in accord with the mission of the unit,
    college and University. Faculty members on sabbatical leave may
    accept teaching assignments for pay subject to the following
    conditions:
    -   The teaching assignment must provide and be part of a variety of
        experiences which serve to improve scholarly/creative
        competence;
    -   Benefits flowing from the teaching assignment must be
        demonstrable in the sabbatical leave plan;
    -   The details of the teaching assignment are clearly defined in
        the sabbatical leave plan and are subject to approval by the
        applicable chairperson/director, dean and Provost or designee
        and agreed to in the best interests of the department/school,
        college and University.
3.  In addition to salary, special arrangements may be made to defray
    travel and similar coincidental expenses, normally provided by
    externally obtained non-general fund grants or other arrangements.
    These arrangements normally should be approved in advance as part of
    the leave application.
4.  A recipient of a sabbatical leave of absence is obligated to return
    to Michigan State University for the following year.  Requests for
    leaves without pay immediately following a sabbatical leave normally
    will not be approved. If a leave no pay is to be recommended, it
    should precede the sabbatical leave.

**Departmental Adjustments**

1.  If a sabbatical leave is granted for one year, academic or fiscal,
    the department involved will be entitled to use the released funds
    for a replacement, provided approval is given by the dean of the
    college.
2.  If leave is granted for less than a year, the department will be
    expected to make adjustments such as suspending courses or by
    reassigning other personnel.
3.  Sabbatical leaves shall not be granted to several members of a
    department concurrently if the efficiency of instruction, research
    and service programs will be impaired.
