**Extending the Reappointment/Promotion/Tenure Review Timeline
(Extending the Tenure Clock)**

 Last updated: 12/9/2015

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following statement was endorsed by the University Committee on
Faculty Tenure; it was issued by the Office of the Provost on June 1,
1990 and revised on April 24, 1996, March 24, 1999, January 10, 2001,
April 13, 2005, November 28, 2012, January 16, 2013, and December 9,
2015.*

 **Automatic Extensions**

The tenure system probationary appointment for the next
reappointment/promotion/tenure review is extended automatically (i.e.,
no faculty request or UCFT review needed) for one year for the following
reasons:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Leaves of absence with or without pay that are one semester to
    twelve months.
2.  Changes in appointment to 50% time or less for one year.
3.  Immigration/visa status that does not permit the award of tenure for
    candidates who have been recommended for tenure.
4.  An extension recommended as an outcome of a hearing and/or appeal
    conducted pursuant to the Faculty Grievance Policy.

 **Extensions Granted Automatically Upon Faculty Request**

In addition to the automatic extensions (1-4) described above, faculty
can request an extension of the reappointment/promotion/tenure review
for the birth or adoption of a child.  Extensions for this reason are
limited to two separate one-year extensions during the entire
probationary period.  The request for an automatic one-year extension
for the birth or adoption of a child must be submitted within two years
of the birth/adoption, but no later than the due date for the submission
to the department/school of the dossier for the next
reappointment/promotion/tenure review.

**Note: ** Receipt of an automatic extension for any of the reasons
above does not preclude consideration for reappointment or promotion
with tenure at the normal time.  However, if the extension for the first
probationary appointment is waived by the faculty member, the extension
does not carry over to the second probationary appointment.  In
addition, a faculty member is bound to the outcome of the reappointment
review if unsuccessful.

 **Extensions Reviewed by the University Committee on Faculty Tenure**
:::

Additional extensions of the probationary appointment may be requested
from the University Committee on Faculty Tenure (UCFT)  for reasons
related to childbirth, adoption, the care of an ill and/or disabled
child, spouse, or parent;  personal illness; to receive prestigious
awards, fellowships, and/or special assignment opportunities; or other
such serious constraints. \
\
In such cases, UCFT considers evidence bearing on the question of
whether the circumstances justify exceptions to the standard procedures
governing the tenure system. UCFT\'s role is not to evaluate the
substantive issues recommended at the departmental or unit level, but to
determine whether, given the circumstances of each case, the proposed
decisions are consistent with the general interest of preserving the
integrity of the tenure system.\
\
To request an extension of the probationary appointment, the department
chair or unit administrator must submit a memorandum to the Associate
Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources that
includes the following information:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  the specific reason delineated in this policy that justifies an
    exception to the standard procedures governing the tenure system;
2.  clear explanation of the impact of the specified condition on the
    normal activities of the faculty member;
3.  what is expected to be achieved at the end of the requested
    extension, including the prospects for success, and a description of
    the resources and/or proposed changes that will be made to
    facilitate success;
4.  a current curriculum vitae and a one-page summary of prior
    assignments in teaching, research, outreach, and administrative
    duties during the previous three years for the faculty member
    seeking the extension;
5.  endorsement and signatures of the faculty member, department chair
    or unit administrator, and dean.
:::

Additionally, the department chair or unit administrator must provide
written documentation from the department or school peer review
committee that they reviewed the extension request and had an
opportunity to render advice as appropriate. The committee\'s approval
is not necessary.

Requests endorsed by the Office of the Provost will be considered by
UCFT according to the standards specified herein.\
