Faculty Handbook

**Disclaimer**

 **I. INTRODUCTION\
**\
The Michigan State University Faculty Handbook contains University
policies, procedures, and other information in effect as of the date of
issuance (see date at the bottom of each Faculty Handbook page). Any
subsequent changes in policies, procedures, or other information are
effective as of the date of action or issuance by the appropriate
University body even though such changes have not been distributed as
revisions or additions to the Michigan State University Faculty
Handbook. Revisions of, or additions to, the Faculty Handbook will be
issued regularly (usually annually) to deans, chairpersons, and
directors. In the interim, every effort will be made to communicate
revisions and additions to deans, directors, and chairpersons for
communication to faculty and academic staff members.
