**Medical Service Plan for Colleges of Human Medicine and Osteopathic
Medicine**

 Last updated: 7/30/1976

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 30,
1976.*

The Medical Service Plan for the Colleges of Human Medicine and
Osteopathic Medicine provides a common framework within which
professional fee income generated by faculty members of the two colleges
is managed. This plan does not apply to the College of Veterinary
Medicine. The plan was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 30,
1976, and takes precedence over all previously existing plans.

The purpose of the plan is to improve the means to supplement basic
support for programs of the medical colleges; sustain and enhance
faculty incentives to engage in patient care which benefits educational
programs, the public and the professional development of the faculty;
and make it financially feasible to recruit and retain highly capable
faculty necessary to develop and sustain quality programs.

The principles of the Medical Service Plan include:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The plan policies, rules and procedures and practices conform to
    established University policies, procedures and practices.
2.  Plan income is University revenue.
3.  Involvement of departmental chairpersons and faculty shall conform
    to the *Bylaws for Academic Governance*.
4.  Plan income shall cover costs of the plan relating to
    administration, billing, and collecting, and costs of practice.
5.  Net income shall be used as authorized within approved guidelines of
    the Health Services Related Component (HSRC) and for program
    support.
6.  A ceiling limit shall be set for personal income that is
    commensurate with comparative medical schools and allowing for
    differences in compensation for rank, experience, specialty, and
    professional competencies.
7.  Under the plan faculty may engage in outside work for pay under
    established University policy.
8.  The plan will be subject to annual review during the first three
    years of its operation and thereafter reviewed at least once every
    three years.
