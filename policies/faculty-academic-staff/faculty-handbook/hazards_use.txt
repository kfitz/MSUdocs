**Use of Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Hazards**

**The use of hazardous materials in research, teaching, and outreach
activities is subject to state and federal laws and guidelines.  The
Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies has been assigned
responsibility to see that appropriate practices are followed where
hazardous materials are involved, to maintain a safe environment for
campus personnel, to protect the surrounding community, and to assure
that MSU meets its obligations under the law.
:::

Oversight of activities involving hazardous substances is provided by
the [Office of Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Safety
(ORCBS)](http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/ "ORCBS info"), which reports to the
Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.  ORCBS is assisted by
faculty committees in the areas of radiation safety, chemical safety,
and biological safety.  The Radiation Safety Committee has
responsibility and authority under federal law for specific actions.

It is University policy that faculty members and principal investigators
(PIs) are responsible for the day-to-day safety and well-being of all
personnel engaged in activities under their aegis.  Administrative
officers, and ORCBS, are responsible for making available to faculty
information needed to maintain a safe working environment, for providing
safety training, for keeping project directors informed about changes in
regulations, and for assaying laboratories and work areas for radiation,
chemical, or biological hazards.

All individuals who work with hazardous substances must accept shared
responsibility for operating in a safe manner once they have been
informed (a) about the extent of risk and (b) about safe procedures that
should be followed.

To support these University policies, a number of responsibilities are
assigned to the project director.  The following list of project
director responsibilities is not necessarily inclusive.  Up-to-date
information is available from the Office of Radiation, Chemical and
Biological Safety.

In general, the project director **must**:

1.  Be aware of appropriate safety policies, procedures, and guidelines
    that apply to the project; if in doubt about any aspect of project
    safety, contact ORCBS to obtain relevant information.
2.  Insure that all personnel under his or her supervision have been
    instructed with regard to the general safety requirements of
    laboratory or work area operations, such as those generally
    associated with Right-to-Know requirements; post warnings and
    restrict entry to work areas containing potentially hazardous
    materials; properly label and store containers of hazardous
    materials; maintain appropriate safety training records (also called
    informed employee consent statements).
3.  Be aware of special hazards that may be inherent in a specific
    activity, and which may not be covered by the general program of
    laboratory safety, inform all personnel under her or his supervision
    of those unique hazards, and provide opportunities for appropriate
    special training.
4.  Understand the risks and regulations associated with receipt and
    subsequent distribution of all hazardous materials.  Federal and
    state regulations control and regulate the use, storage, transport,
    and disposal of certain chemicals, venomous animals, infectious
    agents, pharmaceuticals, recombinant DNA, genetically engineered
    organisms, and radioactive materials. PIs must be aware of the known
    dangers in working with particularly hazardous materials, and must
    take the necessary protective and containment measures, must
    minimize worker exposures to potentially hazardous materials, and
    must follow applicable waste disposal regulations.
5.  **Request and acquire approval from relevant University committees
    or Offices before initiating teaching, research, or service
    activities that involve regulated radioactive, chemical, or
    biological materials.**
6.  Be informed as to whether a spill or release of a regulated or
    controlled material is of a magnitude that ORCBS should be notified,
    and to notify ORCBS immediately when so required; notify ORCBS prior
    to  vacating or closing out a laboratory or other work area
    containing hazardous radioactive, chemical, or biological materials.
