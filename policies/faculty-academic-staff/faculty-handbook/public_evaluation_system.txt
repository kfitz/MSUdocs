**Student Public Evaluation System**

 Last updated: 10/24/2000

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

*The policy on the Student Public Evaluation System provides an
opportunity for students to have access to a range of information
regarding courses and instructors in order to make more informed
decisions in selecting courses.  It is separate and distinct from the
SIRS policy (above) and is intended for different purposes: whereas the
results of the SOCT forms will be public, results of the SIRS forms are
intended to be confidential and are used as one tool for faculty
evaluation.  This statement was approved by the Academic Council on
October 24, 2000.*

Students at Michigan State University have an interest in being able to
make informed judgments in selecting courses and faculty members as
students pursue their academic programs.  To this end, the University
Committee on Academic Policy has framed a set of questions that should
provide the type of information that students seek.  In order to
facilitate the transmission of this information to the students, the
following procedures are established:

1.  In addition to using standard university or unit-based SIRS forms in
    every class each semester in compliance with the Student
    Instructional Rating System policy, faculty members at the rank of
    instructor or above, and specialists who are assigned to teach,
    shall administer a standard form (Student Opinion of Courses and
    Teaching^1 ^) in all of their regular undergraduate classes.
2.  The SOCT forms shall be administered within the last two weeks of
    classes.  Instructors should leave the room until the forms have
    been completed and collected.  The forms should be collected by a
    neutral party, turned in to a predetermined location, and not
    accessible to the instructor until grades are submitted.
3.  Results will be disseminated in summary form, displayed by
    instructor and department, once per year through a Web site
    accessible to students and other members of the University community
    with the appropriate identification.
