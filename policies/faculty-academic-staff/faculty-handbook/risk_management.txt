 Last updated: 12/3/1982

**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 27,
1979 and revised on December 3, 1982.*

**General**

The University shall establish a risk management program which includes
a systematic and continuous identification of loss exposures, the
analysis of these exposures in terms of frequency and severity
probabilities, the application of sound risk control procedures and the
financing of risk consistent with University financial resources.

Each person, regardless of official or unofficial status, who assumes or
is assigned responsibility for the work or activities of others is
administratively responsible for their safety during such work or
activities. Investigation of accidents involving employees or students
during work, class, or sponsored activities is the responsibility of the
person whose job it is to supervise the person injured.

**Patient Care**

The University shall minimize the conditions which may produce an actual
or alleged deficiency in patient care, with the purpose of achieving
high standards of patient care and lowest practicable loss levels. The
President is empowered to establish rules, regulations and procedures
necessary to implement an effective quality assurance and risk
management program.

Supervision of the general and patient care risk management system will
be the administrative responsibility of the Office of Insurance and Risk
Management.\
