**Use of Animals in Research, Teaching, and Outreach**

::: {xmlns=""}
**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR (*Cont.*)**
:::

The use of animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities is
subject to state and federal laws and guidelines. University policy
specifies that:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   all animals under University care (that is, involved in projects
    under the aegis or sponsorship of the University) will be treated
    humanely;
-   prior to their inception, all animal projects receive approval by
    the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC);
-   MSU will comply with state and federal regulations regarding animal
    use and care.
:::

Responsibility for assuring compliance with state and federal
regulations belongs to the Vice President for Research and Graduate
Studies. The Vice President has designated the Assistant Vice President
for Research Ethics and Standards to be the \"Institutional Official\"
as defined in federal regulations.

The IACUC works closely with the Institutional Official, and has
responsibility and authority under federal law for specific actions.

Project directors are responsible for the humane treatment of animals
under their supervision, and for adherence to applicable University,
state, and federal regulations. Faculty members planning to use live
vertebrate animals for any University-related activity must submit an
animal use form (AUF) to the IACUC for review, or request an exemption
from the Committee Chairperson and receive approval, prior to the start
of the project, regardless of the source of funding for the project. The
AUF can be obtained from IACUC; the completed form should include
complete descriptions of experimental protocols, plans for animal care,
available facilities, and any other matters relevant to the project.
Some granting agencies require review and approval of the AUF before a
grant application will be processed. An agency-approved grant will not
be accepted by the Board of Trustees, nor will an account number be
assigned, unless the AUF has been approved by the IACUC or an exemption
has been granted.\
