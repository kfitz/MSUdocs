*The following statement was developed and approved by the University
Committee on Faculty Affairs, March 14, 1978.*

It may happen on occasion that a faculty member is threatened by a
student with harm as a result of some action such as a low grade or an
adverse recommendation the faculty member has taken affecting the
student. Since situations which might occasion such threats vary widely,
as do the personalities of those who may make or receive the threat, it
is difficult to prescribe any simple, generally appropriate response.
However, the following suggestions may be helpful in dealing with such
threats.

Any threat should be reported immediately and in writing to the
department chairperson. If the threat creates a sense of urgency, it
should also be reported at once to the Department of Police and Public
Safety, 355-2223.

The student should be made aware of others, such as the department
chairperson or the Ombudsperson, who could help in obtaining redress. At
the time the threat is made, the faculty member should indicate a
willingness to consider carefully what the student says. If the
student\'s concern appears to be unjustified and the remedy being sought
unreasonable, the faculty member should declare a willingness to consult
with others before taking further action. Indiscriminate discussion of
the incident is to be avoided.\
