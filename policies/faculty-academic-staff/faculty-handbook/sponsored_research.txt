**Sponsored Research and Creative Endeavor**

**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR *(Cont.)***

*The academic governance structure and the Board of Trustees have
approved the following general statement and guidelines concerning
sponsored research.*

**Basic Policies** \
The recognized educational objectives of Michigan State University
include, as equally important goals, the discovery of new knowledge
through fundamental research and the dissemination of existing
knowledge. The increasingly complex relationships among universities,
government and industry call for more intensive attention to standards
of procedure and conduct in government-sponsored research and
industry-sponsored research carried on at universities. Standards for
sponsored research must be respectful of the purposes, needs and
integrity of the universities and the rightful claims of the public
interest; thus it is incumbent upon the academic community to be mindful
of conflict of interest situations which may arise in these growing
involvements of the University.

**General Statement** \
The University encourages faculty/academic staff members and students to
engage in research, including that sponsored by such outside agencies as
foundations, professional associations, government, and private
industry, for it is only through continued and expanding research
activity that the excellence of teaching programs can be maintained and
improved, and the function of the University as a contributor to the
storehouse of knowledge fulfilled. Important reciprocal benefits from
sponsored research accrue to the University and to sponsoring agencies
if the basic purposes and functions of each are duly respected.

**Consulting Relationships** \
Through consulting relationships with government and industry, the
faculty can provide both with an invaluable resource of expertise and
assistance in the transfer of technical knowledge and skill, and at the
same time serve the interests of research and education in the
University. Such relationships are desirable, but require cognizance of
the basic differences of purposes and functions of sponsoring agencies
and the University.

**Major Guidelines** *\
The following statement was approved by the Graduate Council on May 15,
1967 and by the Board of Trustees on March 20, 1970.*

1.  Science advanced through the creativity of scholars working either
    singly or in groups, and research projects proposed and developed by
    the faculty and consistent with the University\'s goals will be
    encouraged.
2.  Sponsoring agencies frequently have rather specific purposes, and
    some may even specify problems for which research support is
    available. The University, through the Office of the Vice President
    for Research and Graduate Studies, will make such opportunities
    known appropriately within the University. However, faculty will be
    encouraged to participate only if the projects are considered
    consistent with their research interests and aspirations.
3.  Sponsored research projects should, whenever possible, include the
    provision that new and promising leads of inquiry should be
    encouraged and fruitless lines be discontinued.
4.  Sponsored research projects should be consistent with the policies
    and missions of the department(s) and of the college(s) in which the
    research will be conducted. The research should be directed by
    faculty within established units of the University such as
    departments, schools, centers, bureaus and institutes. Cooperative
    programs cutting across academic units are also encouraged.
5.  <div>

    Research projects should be managed so as to avoid disruption of
    established research and teaching programs of the institution, for
    example.

    </div>

    1.  Sponsored research should be accepted only if appropriate space
        and facilities are available.
    2.  As appropriate, provisions should be made for continuity of
        support in order to stabilize required staff.

6.  Reports to sponsoring agencies should be consistent with the
    requirements of the project. They should be submitted promptly to
    avoid unprofitable expenditures of time and energy on the part of
    the sponsoring agency and the researcher. Payment to the University
    on fixed price contracts is contingent upon submission of reports
    which, if not forthcoming, may result in \"freezing\" large sums of
    University funds in support of such research. Rapidly changing and
    unforeseen research directions may make frequent reporting
    desirable.
7.  In seeking or accepting support for research, care should be
    exercised to insure compatibility with the functions and purposes of
    research at the University. Routine testing as an end in itself is
    considered incompatible with the purposes of University research.
8.  The University should retain for its scholars the right of first
    publication. The imposition of restriction on publication of
    research results is incompatible with the basic concept of an
    educational institution. Exigencies of national defense may at times
    make exceptions to this policy on publication necessary. No
    publication, statement, or activity, either on behalf of the
    University or by an individual in their official capacity, shall
    endorse any commercial product, or advocate any specific commercial
    method or device, either directly or by implication.
9.  The University should make a continuous effort to see that its own
    members are provided with sufficient information on overall cost of
    research and other financial matters concerning grants and contracts
    so as to minimize internal misconceptions that arise with regard to
    justifiable allowances for indirect costs.
10. The entire cost of sponsored research should be carefully
    determined; if grants or contracts are accepted which do not cover
    the direct and indirect costs, the institution should itself provide
    the additional financial support with the full recognition that it
    is making a contribution to the cost of the work.
11. Research proposals should include in their budgets provisions for
    special costs for services such as computer operations, electron
    microscopy, publishing costs, and shop fabrications.
12. Research projects must conform to established University policy on
    patent rights. (See section on Patents)
13. Research projects which involve use of animals, human subjects or
    hazardous substances such as toxic compounds, infectious agents,
    explosives, radioactive isotopes or recombinant DNA, etc. must
    conform to current University policies and guidelines. (Consult the
    Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.)
