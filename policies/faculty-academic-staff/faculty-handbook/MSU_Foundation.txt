**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR (*Cont.*)**
:::

The Michigan State University Foundation receives and invests royalty
income generated by University patents and licenses and returns funds to
MSU for a variety of research purposes. For example, funding for
Strategic Partnership Grants and for some awards in the Intramural
Research Grants Program and the funds available for development of
intellectual property are derived from the MSU Foundation. The
Foundation does not directly accept proposals from MSU faculty.
Recommendations for projects to receive Foundation funding are the joint
responsibility of the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice
President for Research and Graduate Studies. Faculty are encouraged to
discuss potential proposals first with their department chairpersons and
deans who will forward requests to the Provost and the VPRGS. Support
for projects is often contingent on cost-sharing by the college and
department involved. A portion of MSU Foundation funds supports larger
projects, involving multidisciplinary collaborations, which may lead to
external support for a national center of excellence. Some Foundation
funds are also reserved for support of symposia and conferences. In rare
cases a compelling project may be taken to the Foundation by the Provost
and Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies for special
consideration outside the usual allocation process.\
