**Faculty Rights and Responsibilities**

 Last updated: 7/27/1984

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 27,
1984.*

The [Bylaws](http://trustees.msu.edu/bylaws.html "Board of Trustees Bylaws") of
the Michigan State University Board of Trustees state that \"the
Constitution (of the State of Michigan) confers upon the Board of
Trustees the freedom, power, and responsibility to develop a free and
distinguished university and to promote the welfare of mankind through
teaching, research, and public service.\" **^1,2,3^**

As the primary functions of an academic community, learning, teaching,
scholarship, and public service must be characterized by a fundamental
commitment to academic freedom and maintained through reasoned
discourse, intellectual honesty, mutual respect and openness to
constructive criticism and change. Faculty members, as central to this
community, serve as scholars pursuing the search for knowledge and its
free expression, as teachers instructing students, and as professionals
and citizens contributing special knowledge and skills through public
service and community participation. In the performance of all these
functions faculty members are held accountable to the University, in
accordance with established policies and procedures, by the Board of
Trustees which, as an elected body, is responsible to the people of the
State of Michigan. **^4^**

In order to carry out the mission of the University, faculty members, as
members of both the academic and the broader public community, have the
right to a clear statement of academic freedom, tenure, and other
fundamental faculty rights and responsibilities. The purpose of this
document is to acknowledge these fundamental rights and
responsibilities. **^5^**

**Academic Freedom and Responsibility**

Michigan State University endorses academic freedom and responsibility
as essential to attainment of the University\'s goal of the unfettered
search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom and
responsibility are fundamental characteristics of the University
environment and are always closely interwoven and at times
indistinguishable. Academic freedom and responsibility are the twin
guardians of the integrity and quality of universities. The University
looks to its faculty members to exercise their rights responsibly and to
meet their obligations fully as professionals. Faculty acceptance of
their responsibilities to students, colleagues, the scholarly community,
and the public explains in great part why society historically has
accepted the concept of academic freedom and has afforded its protection
through the institution of academic tenure.

For faculty members, the principal elements of academic freedom include:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The right, as teachers, to discuss in the classroom any material
    which has a significant relationship to the subject matter as
    defined in the approved course description;
2.  The right to determine course content, grading, and classroom
    procedures in the courses they teach;
3.  The right to conduct research and to engage in creative endeavors;
4.  The right to publish or present research findings and creative
    works;
5.  The right to engage in public service activities; and
6.  The right to seek changes in institutional policy through
    established University procedures and by lawful and peaceful means.

Academic freedom carries with it responsibilities. For faculty members,
the principal elements include:

1.  The responsibility to carry out assigned teaching, research, and
    public service duties in a professional manner and in keeping with
    University policy;
2.  The responsibility, as teachers, to refrain from introducing matters
    which are not consistent with their teaching duties and professional
    competence and which have no significant bearing on the subject
    matter of the course as approved under University procedures;
3.  The responsibility to pursue excellence and intellectual honesty in
    teaching, research, and other creative endeavors and in public
    service activities; and in publishing or presenting research
    findings and creative works;
4.  The responsibility to encourage students and colleagues to engage in
    free discussion and inquiry; and to evaluate student and colleague
    performance on a scholarly basis;
5.  The responsibility to work in a collegial manner with appropriate
    individuals and bodies to encourage the free search for knowledge;
    its free exposition, and the University\'s continuing quest for
    excellence; and
6.  The responsibility to differentiate carefully their official
    activities as faculty members from their personal activities as
    citizens and, when the situation warrants, to make it clear that,
    when speaking as private citizens, they do not speak for the
    University.

The above list provides a summary outline of the principal elements of
academic freedom and responsibility. More detailed and explicit
definitional statements applicable to specific faculty rights and
responsibilities are set forth below under the following headings:
Academic Tenure, Academic Governance, Teaching, Research and Creative
Activity, Public Service, Relations with Colleagues, Relation to the
University and the Community, and Resolution of Conflicts.
:::

**Academic Tenure**

The faculty have a right to expect that the University\'s tenure system
is characterized by high integrity and a responsibility to participate
in the operation of the tenure system seriously and in good faith. All
decisions involving tenure system recommendations shall be made in
conformity to the University-approved policies and procedures that
govern the tenure system.

**Academic Governance**

The faculty have a right and responsibility to participate in the
establishment and functioning of a governance system at the department
or school, college, and University levels in accordance with Michigan
State University *Bylaws for Academic Governance* to ensure academic
freedom and the promotion of the goals of the institution. The
University looks to the faculty for recommendations on various academic
personnel matters including faculty appointments, reappointments,
promotions, the award of tenure, and salary increase guidelines; on the
development of new academic programs and the modifications or
discontinuance of existing programs, on academic curricula and
standards; on definition of University mission and goals; on policies
governing research and creative endeavors; on the formulation of annual
budget requests and allocations; and on the selection and review of
specified administrative officials, as well as other issues that concern
the general welfare of the University, including student affairs and the
academic environment.

Through the academic governance system, the University accords a central
role to faculty peer review in the departments or schools, colleges, and
the University. Faculty have a responsibility to participate in peer
review procedures to ensure personnel recommendations which promote
excellence. In accordance with established departmental or school,
college, and University policies, faculty members have the right to be
informed of the standards, criteria, procedures and other conditions
which affect all aspects of their appointment in the tenure system, to
be evaluated in a fair, objective manner, and to receive timely notice
regarding their future appointment status at Michigan State University.

**Teaching**

Because the faculty\'s role in the educational process is primary and
central, the faculty member, as teacher, has the responsibility to make
every effort to be accurate, objective, and effective. In the classroom,
the teacher shall address topics and present materials consistent with
the teaching assignments as defined in the approved course objectives.

The teacher has the responsibility to encourage the pursuit of learning
by students by manifesting the best academic standards of the discipline
or profession. To accord students respect as individuals, the teacher
shall seek to establish a relationship of mutual trust and to establish
an appropriate role as an intellectual guide, counselor and mentor, both
in and out of the classroom. If problems arise in the relationship
between teacher and student, whether on personal matters or on
instructional materials or methods, both teacher and student shall
attempt to resolve them in informal, direct discussions as between
well-intentioned, reasonable persons.

The teacher has the responsibility not to exploit students for private
advantage; the teacher also should avoid any form of discrimination or
harassment, with the understanding that racism, sexism, and other forms
of bias preclude the establishment of an effective learning environment.

The teacher has the responsibility to foster and require honest academic
conduct. The teacher has authority and responsibility for grades and
shall assure that the evaluation and assessment of academic performance
reflect each student\'s true achievement by good faith application of
criteria appropriate to the field of study and the course. The teacher
shall further protect academic freedom for faculty and students by
acknowledging the contributions of students to professional work of
faculty members and by assuring that each student is free to voice
opinions openly and to exchange ideas free from retaliation. Teachers
have the responsibility to observe the University, college and
department/school policies regarding such matters as the statement of
course objectives, examination policy, office hours, course evaluations,
and other provisions of *The Michigan State University Code of Teaching
Responsibility.*

**Research and Creative Activity**

To fulfill the University\'s mission of advancing and disseminating
knowledge for the improvement of the welfare of the public, faculty
members have a responsibility to conduct research and engage in creative
activity in their area(s) of appointment and professional competence.
Recognition of professional competence and definition of area(s) of
appointment occur in the basic academic units (departments, schools,
non-departmentally organized colleges) through procedures in which
established systems of peer review play a central role.

As scholars, faculty members have the right and responsibility to
create, seek, and state knowledge freely and openly and to strive for
scholarly excellence. The scholar has the right and responsibility to
exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in generating, using,
extending, and transmitting knowledge, to adhere to the highest standard
of intellectual honesty, and to oversee and evaluate the research and
creative efforts of students and subordinates. Faculty shall conduct all
research and creative activity in a manner consistent with accepted
scholarly standards and in conformity with legal, professional, and
University codes, policies, and regulations governing research and
creative endeavors.

**Public Service**

As the land-grant university of the State of Michigan, Michigan State
University is committed to public service as an integral aspect of its
mission; this entails a commitment to the creation, dissemination, and
application of knowledge. Public service involves the application of the
faculty member\'s professional training and competence to issues and
problems of significance to constituencies and it is related to academic
program objectives of the unit(s) in which the faculty member is
appointed. Faculty members engaging in public service activities enjoy
the same rights and have the same responsibilities which were previously
stated as pertaining to them as teachers and scholars.

Faculty members, in accordance with University policy and regulations,
can serve as valuable resources and provide valuable services by working
with government, industry, public organizations, and others off-campus.
Faculty members have the right to engage in a limited amount of outside
work for pay in accordance with University policy and regulations.

**Relation with Colleagues**

As colleagues, faculty members have rights and responsibilities that
derive from common membership in a community of scholars. Faculty have
the responsibility to respect and right to defend the free inquiry of
associates and, in the exchange of ideas and criticism, the
responsibility to respect the views and rights of others. Faculty
members shall acknowledge the contributions of colleagues to their own
work. In the evaluation of the professional performance of a colleague,
the faculty member shall provide an honest and objective appraisal in
accordance with established department/school, college, and University
criteria. The faculty member shall foster collaboration with and support
of colleagues. Acts of racism or sexism, including harassment and other
forms of bias and discrimination, violate University policies, and are
unacceptable.

**Relation to the University and the Community**

As members of Michigan State University, the faculty have a primary
responsibility to strive for academic excellence in instruction,
research, and public service. When the situation warrants, faculty
members acting or speaking as citizens have a responsibility to make
clear that these actions and utterances are entirely their own and not
those of the University or any component of the University. Faculty
members have the responsibility not to abuse their standing within the
University for personal or private gain nor use University employees,
facilities, equipment, supplies, or other property for personal or
private business.

As a member of the wider community, the faculty member has the rights
and obligations of any citizen. In exercising these rights, the faculty
member speaks only as an individual, either as a professional scholar
with a field of special competence or as a private citizen.

Faculty members should be mindful that membership in the academic
community inevitably involves identification and association with the
University and that the University often is judged by the actions,
performance, attitudes and expressions of its faculty members. Faculty
members normally do not face a conflict between the exercise of their
rights as a citizen and their responsibilities as a faculty member. If
citizenship activities interfere with faculty responsibilities, faculty
members should request a leave of absence, resign from their
appointment, or limit those activities to ensure a complete discharge of
faculty responsibilities.

**Resolution of Conflicts**

The University is committed to respect the rights of the faculty.
Faculty members who believe that their rights have been violated have
the right to seek redress through the University\'s established
procedures for the hearing and resolution of complaints. Faculty members
have the obligation to meet their responsibilities as defined in this
document and in those cited in Appendix A to help the University
maintain academic excellence and realize its goals. Faculty members
accused of failing to meet these responsibilities have a right to be
informed of the accusations and accorded timely access to University
procedures to determine whether or not the accusations are valid and any
sanctions justified.

**Amendment Procedures**

Amendments to this document may be initiated by any individual member of
the faculty and shall be submitted to the Office of the Provost and the
University Committee on Faculty Affairs for consideration and action in
accordance with Section 4.7.3 of the *Bylaws for Academic Governance*.
