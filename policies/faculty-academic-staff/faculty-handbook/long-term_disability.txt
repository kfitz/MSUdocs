**Long-Term Disability: An Interpretation of the Tenure Rules**

 Last updated: 9/30/2009

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved by the University Committee on
Faculty Tenure (UCFT) on May 19, 1975 and revised by UCFT on April 9,
2003 and September 30, 2009.*

This Policy is applicable to all tenure system faculty.  Tenure system
faculty are eligible to go on long-term disability and receive long-term
disability insurance benefits through the University\'s long-term
disability insurance program.

**GOING ON LONG-TERM DISABILITY\
**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  A faculty member may apply for long-term disability benefits for
    physical or mental health reasons. Application instructions for
    long-term disability benefits are available from Human Resources. 
    Final approval for long-term disability benefits is made by the
    University\'s long-term disability carrier. Information related to
    the University\'s long-term disability insurance program can be
    obtained by contacting Human Resources.
2.  A faculty member must complete 180 days of continuous disability, as
    defined by the University\'s long-term disability carrier, to be
    eligible for long term disability benefits.  Prior to being eligible
    for long-term disability benefits, a faculty member may complete a
    six-month short-term disability leave of absence.  University policy
    regarding short-term disability is located in the *Faculty
    Handbook*.
3.  There is no limit to the number of times a faculty member may apply
    for long-term disability benefits for multiple, unrelated medical
    conditions.
4.  All medical information and records related to the
    short-term/long-term disability process are confidential to the
    degree permitted by law and will be retained in the files of the
    University Physician\'s Office and/or Human Resources.  Medical
    information and/or records relating to short-term/long-term
    disability shall be maintained separately from faculty personnel
    records.  Medical information related to a faculty member\'s
    short-term/long-term disability will be shared with relevant
    University administrators only on a \"need to know\" basis.
5.  Pursuant to the process outlined below, a department chairperson,
    director of a school, or other unit administrator may recommend to
    the appropriate dean(s) that a faculty member be placed on long-term
    disability when the faculty member is no longer carrying out the
    responsibilities for which he/she is appointed and when the
    University Physician concurs that the health of the faculty member
    justifies placement on long-term disability.  The  dean may approve
    or reject the unit recommendation.  If approved, the dean shall
    forward the recommendation to the Provost.  The Provost may approve
    or reject the dean\'s recommendation.  If the unit administrator\'s
    recommendation is approved, the faculty member will initially be
    placed on a short-term disability leave for a  period of up to six
    months.

    If the faculty member\'s health problem continues to make him/her
    unable to carry out the responsibilities for which he/she is
    appointed at the expiration of the six-month short-term disability
    leave, the faculty member must  apply for long-term disability or be
    placed on unpaid leave for a period of up to six months.  If, at the
    conclusion of the unpaid leave, the faculty member continues to be
    unable to carry out his/her responsibilities and the faculty member
    has not applied for or has not been approved for long-term
    disability, the University disciplinary and/or dismissal procedures
    for tenure system faculty members may be implemented.

    A.  Prior to making a formal recommendation to place a faculty
        member on long-term disability, the unit administrator will
        discuss the matter with the faculty member and the University
        Physician. In accordance with the *Health Assessment* statement
        in the Faculty Handbook, the unit administrator may require a
        comprehensive medical assessment of the faculty member to
        determine if  health might be a primary cause of the faculty
        member\'s failure to carry out his/her assigned
        responsibilities. This assessment may be by the University
        Physician or a physician selected by the faculty member and
        acceptable to the University Physician. Based on the assessment,
        the University Physician will advise the unit administrator
        regarding his/her recommendation to place the faculty member on
        long-term disability.
    B.  If the unit administrator requires a medical assessment of the
        individual faculty member, the faculty member must be informed
        in writing of the reasons for requiring the assessment and the
        consequences for failure to cooperate with the assessment,
        including the possibility of disciplinary action.  The faculty
        member must also be informed in writing that he/she may grieve
        the unit administrator\'s decision to require a medical
        assessment under the *Faculty Grievance Policy*.
    C.  When a unit administrator considers recommending that a faculty
        member be placed on long-term disability, he/she shall seek
        advice regarding the faculty member\'s performance of
        responsibilities from the relevant faculty advisory group or by
        faculty members professionally knowledgeable about the
        responsibilities of the faculty member\'s academic position in
        each of the academic units to which the faculty member is
        assigned.
    D.  When reviewing a unit administrator\'s  recommendation to place
        a faculty member on long-term disability, the University
        Physician will normally arrange for a physician to provide
        medical advice in the relevant specialty.  After consultation
        with the appropriate unit administrator(s), the University
        Physician will provide this health care provider with
        information about the terms and conditions of the faculty
        member\'s appointment, the nature of the work required of the
        faculty member, and the concerns raised by the unit
        administrator.  The faculty member may also choose to have
        his/her personal physician contact the University Physician
        regarding the unit administrator\'s recommendation.  The
        University Physician will review the advice of the physician(s)
        and advise the appropriate University administrators regarding
        the advice he/she has received from the other physicians and
        inform the unit administrator if he/she concurs that the health
        of the faculty member justifies placing the faculty member on
        long-term disability.
    E.  If a unit administrator recommends placing a faculty member on
        long-term disability,  the University Physician concurs with
        that recommendation, and that recommendation has been approved
        by the appropriate dean(s) and by the Provost, the faculty
        member must be informed in writing that he/she may utilize
        the *Faculty Grievance Policy* to grieve the unit
        administrator\'s decision to recommend that the faculty member
        be placed on long-term disability.
    F.  These procedures are in place to assure that the relevant
        academic administrators place a faculty member on
        short-term/long-term disability only for bona fide health
        reasons.  A faculty member who believes the short-term/long-term
        disability process is being used to bypass the procedures
        governing discipline or dismissal of a tenured faculty member
        may utilize the *Faculty Grievance Policy*, per 5(B) and 5(E)
        above.
    G.  If at any point in this process the faculty member elects to
        apply for long-term disability, the routine application
        procedure administered by Human Resources applies.

**REINSTATEMENT / REASSIGNMENT FROM LONG-TERM DISABILITY** \
\
**Probationary Faculty Members:**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The University shall hold a probationary tenure system faculty
    member\'s position \"open\" for the remainder of the faculty
    member\'s current probationary appointment or a maximum period of
    two years, whichever is less, filling the vacant position, if
    necessary, with interim appointments.  At any time during the
    current probationary appointment the faculty member may seek to be
    reinstated to the position vacated due to his/her long-term
    disability status.  The University shall respond promptly to such a
    request.  If, at the expiration of the current probationary
    appointment, the faculty member has not been reinstated, the faculty
    member\'s employment will be terminated.  The University\'s
    long-term disability insurance coverage may continue to provide
    benefits after the termination of the faculty member\'s employment. 
    Information regarding the University\'s long-term disability
    insurance program is available from Human Resources.
    A.  A faculty member seeking reinstatement under this provision
        should address the request for reinstatement to his/her unit
        administrator in writing.  A copy of the request and medical
        documentation from his/ her treating physician to support the
        request should be sent to the University Physician. 
        Reinstatement under this provision requires approval by the
        University Physician, the appropriate administrative
        endorsements, and approval by the Provost.
    B.  A faculty member reinstated under this provision shall resume
        his/her duties consistent with the job expectations currently in
        place for probationary tenure system faculty with similar
        positions within that unit at the time reinstatement is granted.
:::

**Tenured Faculty Members:**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The University shall hold a faculty member\'s tenured position
    \"open\" for two years from the date he/she is placed on long-term
    disability by the University\'s long-term disability carrier,
    filling the vacant position, if necessary, with interim
    appointments.  At any time during the two-year period the faculty
    member may seek to be reinstated to the position vacated due to
    his/her long-term disability status.  The University shall respond
    promptly to such a request.  If, at the expiration of two years, the
    faculty member remains on long-term disability and has not been
    reinstated, the position need no longer be held \"open\" and the
    faculty member\'s employment will be terminated.  The University\'s
    long-term disability insurance coverage may continue to provide
    benefits after the termination of the faculty member\'s employment. 
    Information regarding the University\'s long-term disability
    insurance program is available from Human Resources.
    A.  A faculty member seeking reinstatement under this provision
        should address the request for reinstatement to his/her unit
        administrator in writing.  A copy of the request and medical
        documentation from his/her treating physician to support the
        request should be sent to the University Physician. 
        Reinstatement under this provision requires approval by the
        University Physician, the appropriate administrative
        endorsements, and approval by the Provost.
    B.  A faculty member reinstated under this provision shall resume
        his/her duties consistent with the job expectations currently in
        place for tenured faculty with similar positions within that
        unit at the time reinstatement is granted.
2.  If, within the two-year period, the faculty member is not capable of
    resuming the assigned duties of the vacated tenured position, but is
    capable of assuming another full-time tenured position commensurate
    with his/her education, training, and experience, a reasonable
    effort shall be made during the two-year period to place him/her in
    such a position, if such a position is available.
    A.  A faculty member seeking reassignment under this provision
        should address the request for reassignment to the Provost in
        writing.  A copy of the request and  medical documentation from
        his/ her treating physician to support the request should be
        sent to the University Physician.  Reassignment under this
        provision requires approval by the University Physician, the
        appropriate administrative endorsements, and approval by the
        Provost.
3.  If, after the expiration of the two-year period, the former faculty
    member asks to return to service at the University, and he/she
    provides documentation from his/her treating physician that
    indicates that he/she is capable of performing the responsibilities
    of a full-time faculty member, the University shall give strong
    consideration to the re-employment of the individual when a vacancy
    occurs in the area of his/her professional competence; however, the
    individual has no prior claim to the vacancy.
    A.  An individual seeking re-employment under this provision should
        address the request for employment to the Provost in writing.  A
        copy of the request and medical documentation from his/ her
        treating physician to support the request should be sent to the
        University Physician.  Re-employment under this provision
        requires approval by the University Physician, the appropriate
        administrative endorsements, and approval by the Provost.
    B.  The terms of employment for an individual re-employed under this
        provision will be consistent with the position for which the
        individual applied and was re-hired.  For example, the
        individual might be appointed as a  fixed-term,  probationary,
        or tenured faculty member, depending on the specific position
        for which the individual was re-hired.
4.  If, either during or after the two-year period, the faculty member
    or former faculty member is not capable of performing the duties of
    a full-time faculty member but provides documentation from his/her
    treating physician that indicates he/she is capable of other
    employment within the University, the University shall make
    reasonable efforts to find a suitable alternative position for that
    individual at the University. 
    A.  A faculty member seeking an appointment under this provision
        should address the request in writing to the Provost or
        appropriate Vice President, depending on the position sought.  A
        copy of the request and medical documentation from his/her
        treating physician to support the request should be sent to the
        University Physician.  Appointment under this provision requires
        approval by the University Physician, the appropriate
        administrative endorsements, and, as appropriate, approval by
        the Provost or by the relevant Vice President.
5.  If a tenured faculty member is reinstated in a tenured faculty
    position within the two-year period and subsequently is unable to
    perform his/her responsibilities for health reasons:
    A.  Long-term disability status will be reinstated (for the same
        condition for which long-term disability status was originally
        approved) if the period for which the faculty member has
        returned to work is twelve months or less.
    B.  A six month short-term disability leave will be required to
        re-qualify for long-term disability if the period of return to
        work is greater than twelve months and the disability results
        from the same condition for which the long-term disability
        status was originally approved, or if the faculty member\'s
        disability is not the same condition for which long-term
        disability status was originally approved.
    C.  In case of 5.A. or 5.B. above, there is no extension of the
        two-year period for which the tenured position is held open (for
        the same condition for which the long-term disability status was
        originally approved).
6.  If a tenured faculty member is reinstated, re-employed, or
    reassigned to a tenured position, he/she shall have full rights of
    tenure.
:::

**General Principles:**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  For any reinstatement, reassignment, or re-employment, a faculty
    member will be expected to perform the job duties and meet the job
    expectations in place for faculty with similar positions within the
    unit without exception, unless a reasonable accommodation has been
    requested and granted.
2.  When reviewing a request for reinstatement, reassignment, or
    re-employment, the University Physician will review the medical
    documentation provided from the faculty member\'s treating physician
    and will normally arrange for another physician to provide medical
    advice in the relevant specialty. After consultation with
    appropriate unit administrator(s), the University Physician will
    provide this health care provider with information about the terms
    and conditions of the faculty member\'s appointment and the nature
    of the work required of the faculty member.  The University
    Physician will receive the advice from the physicians and advise the
    appropriate University administrators regarding
    reinstatement/reassignment/re-employment.
3.  When a faculty member returns from long-term disability, he/she
    shall perform the duties of teaching, research, and service with
    full guarantee of academic freedom.
4.  The academic freedom of a faculty member is in no way compromised by
    his/her long-term disability status.
