**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***
:::

The following items must be furnished to the Payroll Division of the
Office of the Controller before a new faculty/academic staff member can
be put on the University payroll.

::: {xmlns=""}
1\. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. Social security numbers must be verified by
the Payroll Office, 350 Administration Building, prior to the first pay
date. Verification may be completed by presenting the social security
card to the Payroll Office or by sending a photocopy to that office.

2\. EMPLOYEE TAX WITHHOLDING CERTIFICATES. Various forms (W-4, MI-W-4.
City Tax Withholding) authorize the University to recognize the
appropriate exemptions when calculating Federal, State of Michigan and
local withholding taxes.
:::

New faculty/academic staff members should at the same time complete the
appropriate forms in the Human Resources office to participate in such
programs as employee-paid life, health care coverage, accidental death
and dismemberment, and base and supplemental retirement benefits. All
benefit programs are described briefly in the Faculty/Academic Staff
Benefit and Retirement Programs section of this handbook. Additional
information is available from Human Resources, 110 Nisbet Building.\
