**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES (*Cont.*)**
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on June 11,
1993.*

Leaves of absence, with or without pay, may be granted to
faculty/academic staff members. Recommendations for leaves of absence
originate in the department, school or comparable unit and must be
reviewed successively by the dean and the provost, who makes the final
decision. Leaves usually do not extend beyond one year.

Leaves of absence, other than for sickness or for military service, are
not granted automatically but are intended for the mutual benefit of the
University and the faculty/academic staff member.

Leaves will not be granted unless satisfactory arrangements are made in
advance to:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Carry on the instruction, research, extension and administrative
    duties of the faculty/academic staff member,
-   Fulfill obligations to graduate students whose programs or theses
    are being directed by the faculty member and
-   Fulfill obligations to committee assignments.
:::

Specific dates for the leave must be specified in the request and should
be made as far in advance as possible. \
A faculty/academic staff member who without good cause fails to return
to the University within a reasonable time after a term break,
sabbatical, or other leave of absence, shall forfeit rights to further
employment and shall be considered as having resigned. In such
circumstances, the following procedures shall apply in lieu of the
Dismissal for Cause procedures.

The Provost or designee shall inform the faculty/academic staff member
that the failure to return may be treated as a resignation and provide
the person with an opportunity to respond. If the faculty/academic staff
member cannot be contacted after a reasonable effort, the Provost or
designee shall proceed on the basis of the information available.

The Provost or designee shall decide whether the failure to return shall
be considered a resignation. The faculty/academic staff member may
initiate a grievance under the [Faculty Grievance
Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/grievance_policy.html "Faculty Grievance Policy ") if
he or she disagrees with the Provost or designee\'s decision within 30
days of receipt of the Provost\'s or designee\'s decision. If a
grievance is filed, the faculty member will be granted an unpaid leave
during the pendency of the grievance. In the case of tenured or tenure
system faculty, the initial hearing panel shall include at least three
members of the University Committee on Faculty Tenure.\
