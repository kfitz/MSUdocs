*The Student Instructional Rating System provides an opportunity for
students to evaluate the instruction they receive in relation to (1) the
provisions of the Code of Teaching Responsibility, and (2) the various
instructional models in operation in the University. The purpose of this
system is to provide student input toward assessing and improving course
design and teaching performance. The University and individual
departments are responsible for designing and administering their
respective survey forms to obtain such evaluations. The results of these
surveys are made available to the instructor and to persons involved in
personnel decisions, but are not made public.*

*The revised Student Instructional Rating System Policy which follows
was approved by the Academic Council on March 6, 1979.*

**Preamble**

The principal objective of the Student Instructional Rating Policy is to
secure information which is indispensable to implementation of the
University\'s policy of providing its students with instruction of the
highest quality. This information is put to two principal uses: (1)
providing instructors and teaching units with an accurate account of
student response to their instructional practices, to the end that
classroom effectiveness be maintained at the highest level of
excellence; and (2) providing teaching units with one kind of
information to be considered in deciding on retention, promotion,
salary, and tenure, to the end that effectiveness in instruction
constitutes an important criterion in evaluating the service to the
University of members of the teaching faculty. In order to accomplish
these objectives more fully, the following procedures are established to
replace the provisions previously in effect.

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Every teaching unit shall approve one or more common student rating
    instruments through its own channels of participation, in accordance
    with unit bylaws and customs of collegial decision making.
    Regardless of the type of instrument adopted, it must prominently
    display the following notation:
2.  The Michigan State University [Code of Teaching
    Responsibility](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/teaching_responsibilily.html "Code of Teaching Responsibility") holds
    all instructors to certain obligations with respect to, e.g., course
    content consistent with approved descriptions, timely statement of
    course objectives and grading criteria, regular class attendance,
    published office hours, and timely return of examinations and term
    papers. This Code is printed in full in the *Catalog* and *Schedule
    of Courses.* It includes specifics about complaint procedures
    available to students who believe that their instructors have
    violated the Code.

3.  Each teaching unit shall make regular and systematic use of student
    instructional ratings as part of the unit\'s evaluation of
    instructional performance. Each teaching unit shall formulate and
    promulgate a comprehensive policy covering all aspects of student
    instructional rating procedures, and shall be responsible for
    implementing that policy within the framework of the provisions
    contained in this document. Students shall not be required or
    requested by faculty members to identify themselves on rating forms.
4.  All instructors, regardless of rank, including graduate assistants,
    shall use unit-approved student instructional rating forms in all
    classes (every course, every section, every term). For team-teaching
    situations, units shall develop procedures consistent with the
    intent of these provisions.
5.  Individual instructors may use other instruments to gather
    additional information.
6.  Results of student instructional ratings shall be used in accordance
    with the following provisions: \
    1.  Results shall be returned promptly to the instructor for
        information and assistance in improving course design and
        instruction.
    2.  Instructors shall have the opportunity to comment, orally and/or
        in writing, upon the ratings received. These comments shall be
        taken into account by persons or groups charged with making or
        advising on personnel decisions.
    3.  Results of student instructional ratings shall be systematically
        consulted, with due regard for strict confidentiality, in
        conjunction with other means for assessing individual
        effectiveness, according to the review criteria promulgated
        within each unit. Other means might include, e.g., classroom
        visits or consideration of course syllabi, assignments, and
        examinations.
7.  Procedures for implementing the rating process and for utilizing the
    results shall be promulgated by each teaching unit, subject to the
    following provisions: \
    1.  Duly promulgated unit procedures shall be filed in the offices
        of the appropriate dean and the provost, where they will be
        matters of public record.
    2.  Unit administrators are responsible for implementing in their
        units SIRS procedures which follow fully the requirements of
        this document.
    3.  Teaching units may have the required SIRS instruments
        administered by a person other than the instructor. If the unit
        does not administer the instruments, instructors are obligated
        to do so, and to return all results to unit offices within the
        time period specified in unit procedures.
    4.  At the time instruments are administered, students shall be
        informed who will have access to the results and how the results
        will be used.
