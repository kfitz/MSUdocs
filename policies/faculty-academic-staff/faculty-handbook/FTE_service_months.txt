This concept is defined as the cumulative full-time equivalent (FTE)
months of service for University employment of 50% or greater. FTE
service months are used in determining eligibility for University
benefits which require a service waiting period.

Faculty/academic staff hired prior to July 1, 2010 and meeting the
minimum retirement requirements\* will remain eligible to maintain
health, prescription drug and dental coverage and receive the
employer\'s contribution based on the following. Please see the [Retiree
Benefits

If a faculty/academic staff member retires with 15 or more years of
service and is at least age 62, the following FTE service month ranges
will determine their health, prescription drug and dental University
contribution level during retirement.
