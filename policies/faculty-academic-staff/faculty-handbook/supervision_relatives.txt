**Supervision of Academic Work by Relatives**

 Last updated: 3/22/1994

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved at the March 22, 1994 meeting of the
Academic Council.*

No faculty member may:

1.  serve as a member of a relative\'s graduate committee;
2.  serve as a member of a relative\'s honor\'s thesis, master\'s thesis
    degree, or doctoral dissertation committee;
3.  directly assign a grade to a relative enrolled in her or his class.
    (Exceptions to this policy may be made with prior approval of the
    appropriate administrator.)

This policy does not prevent enrollment of a student in a class taught
by a relative. It does require disclosure and assurance of fair grading,
i.e., grading by a disinterested party.\
