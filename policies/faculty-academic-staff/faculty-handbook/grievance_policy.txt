**Faculty Grievance Policy**

### **IV. ACADEMIC AND HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES**  I. POLICY STATEMENT {#iv.-academic-and-human-resources-policies-i.-policy-statement xmlns=""}

::: {xmlns=""}
This Policy is intended to provide a fair, internal process for
resolving employment related disputes that arise between faculty or
academic staff members and administrators. The formal procedures
described in this Policy are intended to be used only when matters
cannot be resolved informally. A faculty or academic staff member who
feels aggrieved should first seek an informal resolution at the unit,
department, or college level before filing a formal grievance under this
Policy. The procedures contained in this Policy are not intended to be
used to challenge the desirability of unit or University policies.
:::

### II. DEFINITIONS {#ii.-definitions xmlns=""}

A. Grievance: A written complaint filed by a faculty or academic staff
member against an administrator of the University alleging a violation
of University, college, department, school, or unit policy or
established practice.

B. Faculty member: A person with a paid University appointment at the
rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or
instructor, including those with fixed-term and visiting status.

C. Academic Staff: A person with a paid University appointment at the
rank of academic specialist, lecturer, assistant instructor, research
associate, or librarian, including those in a continuing appointment
system and those with fixed-term and visiting status.

D. Administrator: A person appointed as the head of an administrative
unit, school director, department chair, dean, or separately reporting
director.^1^ The President, the General Counsel and members of the
General Counsel\'s staff, and the Faculty Grievance Official (\"FGO\")
are not subject to grievance under this Policy.

E. Policy: A written statement of principles and procedures that govern
the actions of faculty, academic staff, and administrators, including
written rules, bylaws, procedures, or standards.

F. Practice: Actions taken by the administrator within an administrative
or academic unit based on customs or standards in that unit that are
usually unwritten but of longstanding duration, and for whose existence
the grievant can offer evidence.

G. Violation: A breach, misinterpretation, or misapplication of existing
policy or established practice.

### III. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE {#iii.-grievance-procedure xmlns=""}

A faculty or academic staff member may file a formal grievance against
an administrator that alleges a violation of University, college,
department, school, or unit policy or established practice.^2^

A. INITIATION OF GRIEVANCE PROCEEDINGS

A faculty /academic staff member who feels aggrieved may discuss his/her
complaint in a confidential conference with the FGO. The FGO shall
inform the faculty /academic staff member if the potential grievance
falls under the jurisdiction of another University policy rather than
this Policy.

B. FILING A GRIEVANCE

To file a grievance, an individual faculty or academic staff member must
submit a written, signed statement (the \"grievance\") to the FGO within
28 days^3^ of the date that the grievant knew or should have known of
the alleged violation.^4^ The grievance must contain the following
information:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  the specific policy or established practice that has allegedly been
    violated;
2.  the date of the alleged violation and the date on which the grievant
    became aware of the alleged violation;
3.  the facts relevant to the alleged violation;
4.  the person(s) against whom the grievance is filed (the
    \"respondent\"); and
5.  the redress sought.
:::

The grievant must also submit any documents that are relevant to the
FGO\'s initial jurisdictional findings pursuant to Section III.D of this
Policy.

C. THE RESPONDENT

The FGO will provide a copy of the grievance and any documents submitted
with the grievance to the respondent within three (3) days of receipt.
The respondent shall submit any relevant documents concerning the FGO\'s
initial jurisdictional findings to the FGO within seven (7) days of
receipt of the grievance.

D. JURISDICTIONAL & PROCEDURAL DECISIONS

1\. The FGO shall determine whether the following jurisdictional
requirements have been met within 14 days of the date that the grievance
was filed. The FGO may also seek information from appropriate University
office(s) to assist in making these jurisdictional determinations.

a\. Whether the grievant has standing under the Faculty Grievance
Policy;\
b. Whether the grievance has been filed in a timely fashion; \
c. Whether the grievance identifies an appropriate respondent(s); \
d. Whether the grievance adequately identifies the existing policies
and/or established practices alleged to have been violated;^5^ \
e. Whether the grievance contains a reasonably adequate statement of the
facts relevant to the complaint; and\
f. Whether any other jurisdictional issue(s) need to be decided in
connection with the initiation of the grievance and, if so, an
explanation of such issues.

2\. The FGO shall inform the parties in writing whether each
jurisdictional requirement has been met, along with the names of any
University offices consulted regarding the jurisdictional
decisions.^6^ If any jurisdictional requirement has not been met, the
FGO shall dismiss the grievance.

3\. Each party shall have the right to appeal the FGO\'s jurisdictional
decisions by filing a written statement explaining the reason(s) for the
appeal with the FGO within 14 days of the issuance of such decision.

4\. If any party files an appeal of the FGO\'s jurisdictional
decision(s), the FGO shall submit the written appeal, together with any
written response to the appeal from the parties and a written response
by the FGO, to a three-person jurisdictional appeal panel drawn randomly
by the FGO from the list of faculty, librarians, and other academic
staff eligible to serve as members of the University Hearing Board or
University Appeals Board. (See Section III.H of this Policy.) The panel
shall deliberate and submit to the FGO a written decision (including the
basis for its decision) on the appeal within seven (7) days of its
convening by the FGO. No faculty member, librarian, or other academic
staff member may serve on more than one jurisdictional appeal panel in
any period of seven consecutive years.

5\. The FGO shall forward a copy of the jurisdictional appeal panel\'s
decision to the parties within seven (7) days of its receipt from the
panel.

E. INFORMAL RESOLUTION

1\. The FGO shall confer with the parties and make every reasonable
effort to resolve the grievance informally as quickly as possible.
Discussions regarding informal resolution are expected to be treated
with confidentiality and may not be disclosed or referenced during any
subsequent formal proceedings on the grievance. The FGO may recommend
that the grievant drop the grievance because it lacks merit or for other
just cause. Such a recommendation, however, shall not be binding on the
grievant.

2\. If the FGO determines that the grievance cannot be informally
resolved, the FGO shall so notify the parties in writing. If the
grievant wishes to pursue the grievance, the grievant must submit a
written request for a formal hearing to the FGO within 14 days of such
notice. Failure to submit such a request will constitute a waiver of the
faculty member\'s right to pursue the grievance.

F. AMENDMENTS

A grievant may amend his/her grievance until 28 days before the
scheduled date for the formal hearing on the grievance, as long as the
proposed amendment concerns the same subject matter as the grievance.
The FGO shall decide whether to accept the proposed amendment, and any
jurisdictional issues generated by the proposed amendment, at least 21
days before the scheduled date for the formal hearing. Either party may
challenge the FGO\'s decision by filing a written appeal with the FGO
within seven (7) days of the FGO\'s decision. Such appeals are processed
in the same manner as other jurisdictional appeals under Section III.D.4
of this Policy. Any procedural issues (such as submission of new
documents) generated by the amendment shall be decided by the hearing
panel at the beginning of the hearing.

G. CONSOLIDATION OF GRIEVANCES

If a grievant files two or more separate grievances against the same
respondent(s) that raise related allegations or arise from a common set
of facts, the FGO may consolidate such grievances into one grievance to
be heard by a single panel. If a grievant files two or more separate
grievances concerning different issues and the grievances are not
consolidated, such grievances will normally be processed and heard
sequentially in chronological order determined by the date on which the
initial grievance was filed. Separate grievances filed by different
grievants that involve related allegations or arise from a common set of
facts may also be consolidated.

H. GRIEVANCE HEARING AND APPEAL PANEL COMPOSITION

1\. A University Hearing Board and University Appeals Board shall be
established from which grievance hearing and appeal panels shall be
selected.

2\. All faculty with appointment in the tenure system, librarians and
other academic staff with appointment in a continuing appointment
system, and full-time fixed-term faculty who have served at least three
consecutive years and are engaged in the academic activities of the
University on a regular basis are eligible and expected to serve as
members of the University Hearing Board or University Appeals
Board.^7^ No faculty/academic staff member or librarian may serve on
more than one grievance hearing or appeal panel in any period of seven
consecutive years. At the start of each academic year, the Academic
Human Resources Office will provide the FGO with a list of all faculty,
academic staff, and librarians eligible to serve on these Boards.^8^

3\. A grievance hearing panel shall consist of five members of the
University Hearing Board who are selected randomly by the FGO. An appeal
panel shall consist of three members of the University Appeals board who
are selected randomly by the FGO. Panel members shall serve throughout
an entire proceeding.

4\. The FGO shall take necessary precautions to avoid any conflict of
interest on the part of the panel members. No panel member shall be from
the same department(s) (or college in the case of non-departmental
colleges) as the grievant or respondent.

5\. A panel selected for a grievance involving the denial of
reappointment or tenure in the tenure system shall be comprised solely
of tenured faculty members. A panel selected for a grievance involving
the denial of promotion to full professor shall be comprised solely of
tenured faculty who hold the rank of full professor.

6\. A panel selected for a grievance involving the denial of
reappointment or promotion in an appointment system other than the
tenure system shall be comprised solely of faculty members at the same
rank.

7\. Each grievance hearing panel shall have a Presiding Officer selected
at random by the FGO from a list established by the UCFA. The Presiding
Officer shall have voice but not be a voting member of the hearing
panel. The Presiding Officer shall apply the rules of procedure
consistent with the guidelines stated in Section III.I of this Policy.

8\. The FGO shall notify each party of the names of the Presiding Officer
(if applicable) and members of the panel. Within seven (7) days of that
notice, either party may submit a written challenge to the Presiding
Officer or any member of the panel for cause. The challenge must explain
the cause for removing the Presiding Officer or panel member. The FGO
shall determine whether there is cause to dismiss the challenged member
of the panel and select another member.^9 ^In addition, each party shall
have two peremptory challenges. The FGO shall notify the parties of any
replacement Presiding Officer or members of the panel. Either party may
submit a challenge for cause or any peremptory challenge to any
replacement Presiding Officer or member of the panel to the FGO within
three (3) days of that notice.

9\. If a grievance hearing panel loses two or more of its members during
the course of a hearing, the hearing shall be terminated, and a new
panel selected.

I. GRIEVANCE HEARINGS: PROCEDURES
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Hearings shall be scheduled as expeditiously as possible and with
    due regard for the schedule of both parties. Grievances involving
    faculty/academic staff who hold academic year (AY) appointments will
    normally not be held during summer semester unless the
    faculty/academic staff member has a summer appointment. On the rare
    occasion when a party fails to respond to repeated attempts to
    schedule a hearing or unreasonably delays the scheduling of a
    hearing, the Faculty Grievance Office will schedule the hearing for
    the first date available to the panel members and the other party.
2.  The FGO shall convene the hearing panel and shall be present during
    all formal proceedings. The FGO shall provide written notice of the
    time and place of the hearing, the names of counsel, the names of
    any witnesses, and copies of any documents submitted by the parties
    and deemed relevant by the FGO, to each party at least seven (7)
    days before the hearing.
3.  The hearing shall be conducted in good faith and must be completed
    within 14 calendar days unless the FGO determines that an extension
    of time is necessary.
4.  All hearings shall be recorded. A party may request and obtain a
    copy of the recording from the FGO.
5.  Hearings shall be closed unless the parties agree otherwise.
6.  The privacy of confidential records used in the hearing shall be
    respected.
7.  All parties may present their cases in person and may call witnesses
    on their behalf. The names of witnesses must be provided to the FGO
    at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing date.
8.  A party may elect not to appear, in which event the hearing will be
    held in his or her absence. Absence of a party shall not be
    prejudicial to the case. The FGO may grant permission for a party to
    appear via alternate communication methods for good cause.
9.  All parties are entitled to counsel of their choice. The name of
    counsel must be provided to the FGO at least seven (7) days prior to
    the hearing date.
10. Any party or counsel shall be entitled to ask pertinent questions of
    any witness or the other party at appropriate points in hearings.
    The Presiding Officer shall determine what questions are pertinent.
11. The grievant bears the burden of proving that there has been a
    violation of policy or established practice. A hearing panel shall
    decide whether the preponderance of the evidence supports the
    allegations made by the grievant.^10^
12. Hearing panels shall resolve any procedural issues raised by the
    parties, after providing each party the opportunity to be heard on
    such matters. However, neither party may challenge the FGO\'s
    initial jurisdictional findings made pursuant to Section III.D of
    this Policy. The FGO shall distribute all documents submitted by the
    parties concerning procedural issues to the hearing panel, and shall
    include such documents in the grievance record.
13. Hearing panels may consider evidence submitted by the parties
    concerning the relative credentials of other faculty members in
    determining the merit of grievances involving salary, appointment,
    re-appointment, or promotion.
14. Hearing panels shall report their findings and recommendations in
    writing within 21 days of the completion of the hearing to the FGO,
    who shall forward them to the grievant, the respondent, their
    counsel, the Provost, or the President, as appropriate, and to the
    administrator who is the respondent\'s immediate supervisor. The
    hearing panel\'s report is advisory to the Provost and does not bind
    the Provost to a particular decision.
15. When a hearing panel sustains an allegation made in a grievance, it
    shall recommend appropriate redress consistent with existing
    policies, procedures, and practices.
16. The Provost shall decide the grievance, in writing, within 28 days
    of receipt of the hearing panel\'s findings and recommendations.^11^
17. All parties shall be notified in writing of their right to appeal by
    the FGO when a copy of any decision is forwarded to the parties.

### Footnotes: {#footnotes xmlns=""}

::: {xmlns=""}
 ^1^ If a grievance is filed against the Provost individually, a hearing
will be held pursuant to Section III.I of this Policy. The finding(s)
and recommendation(s) of the Hearing Panel will be forwarded to the
President for decision instead of to the Provost. The President\'s
decision will be final and not subject to appeal.
:::

 ^2^ This Policy and its grievance procedures may not be utilized by
faculty or academic staff who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement.

 ^3 ^References to days in this document are to calendar days. If a
deadline contained within this Policy falls on a weekend or University
holiday, the deadline will be extended to the next day on which the
University is open for business.

 ^4 ^The FGO may waive or extend the time limits specified in this
Policy for good cause or by mutual agreement of the parties. \"Good
cause\" includes, but is not limited to, circumstances outside of a
party\'s control, such as illness, approved leave of absence, or
extended travel for University business. Even with a showing of good
cause, time limits will generally not be extended beyond an additional
28 days.

 ^5 ^As part of the initial jurisdictional determination, the FGO shall
determine whether the policy specified in the grievance applies to the
named respondent.

 ^6 ^Notices provided under this Policy will be delivered to the campus
address for both the grievant and respondent unless either party
notifies the Faculty Grievance Office in writing that an alternate
address should be used.

 ^7^ An individual who also holds an appointment as an Administrator is
not eligible to serve as a Presiding Officer or as a member of the
University Hearing Board or University Appeals Board.\

 ^8^ An individual who is on a sabbatical or other approved leave of
absence is excused from service on the University Hearing Board and
University Appeals Board for the duration of the leave.\

 ^9^ The standard the FGO shall follow in ruling on challenges is
whether, in light of the challenged person\'s knowledge of the case or
personal or professional relationships with a party, the challenged
person would be able to fairly and impartially hear the case and to
render a fair and impartial judgment. \

 ^10^ \"Preponderance of the evidence\" means that the existence of the
fact in issue is more probable than not. The \"preponderance\" of the
evidence standard would be met where the members of the hearing panel
find that the evidence supporting at least one of the allegations in the
grievance is more convincing than the opposing evidence.\

 ^11^ The FGO shall forward the Provost\'s decision to the parties,
their counsel, and the members of the hearing panel within three (3)
days of its receipt.\
