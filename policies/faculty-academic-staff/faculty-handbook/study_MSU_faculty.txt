**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)* ** **^1^**
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Academic Council on May 1,
1973. Policies and procedures were reaffirmed by the Graduate Council on
February 14, 1977, with the instruction that the dean of The Graduate
School monitor programs of all faculty members pursuing MSU doctorates
and notify any faculty members not in compliance.*

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  No MSU faculty member with the rank of professor, associate
    professor, or assistant professor, or instructor in the tenure
    system, may earn a doctoral degree at MSU. Any waiver of this
    regulation may be made only by agreement of the Graduate Council and
    the provost prior to the beginning of the program.
2.  Full-time faculty members may carry an average of four credits a
    semester with a maximum of 8 credits in the academic year. Fees are
    based on the number of credits carried, in the same manner as for
    other students.
3.  A full-time faculty member may enroll in credit courses as an
    auditor with prior approval from the chairperson of the department
    offering the course and from the faculty member\'s department
    chairperson. No charge is made.
4.  This regulation removes the master\'s degree from the prohibition
    and it does not apply to the graduate-professional degrees: D.O.,
    D.V.M. M.D.

**Footnote:**

**^[1]{#Footnote1} ^** In this policy, \"Provost\" means \"Office of the
Provost\" and that the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President
for Academic Human Resources (or other administrator in the Provost\'s
Office) has been delegated responsibility for this role in order to
clearly separate any future decision making required by the Provost
pursuant to the Faculty Grievance Policy with respect to
implementation/enforcement of this policy.\
