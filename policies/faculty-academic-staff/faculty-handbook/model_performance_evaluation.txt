    performance evaluated on an annual \[or academic year as units
    decide\][ ^1^ ](/documents/facacadhandbooks/facultyhandbook/FASPerfReviewModel.pcf#UnitDiscretion "Unit Discretion AN or AY")basis
    consistent with the timing for other unit faculty, or within three
    months after the end of their appointment period.
-   The evaluation of fixed term faculty and academic staff shall be

    multiple units, this department will serve as the lead for
    performance evaluations where it is the lead unit for the
    appointment. This will include coordinating with the other unit(s)
    on performance planning, reporting, and evaluation to make things as
