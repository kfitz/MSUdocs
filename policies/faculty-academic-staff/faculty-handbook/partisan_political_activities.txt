**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on December
12, 1950.*

As citizens, the faculty/academic staff members of Michigan State
University have the same rights and responsibilities of free speech,
thought, and action as all citizens of the United States. Their
position, however, imposes special obligations, such as emphasizing that
they are not institutional spokespersons, and exercising appropriate
restraint.

Obviously, faculty/academic staff members have a binding obligation to
discharge instructional and other regular duties, and performance of
these duties may be impaired by any private activity requiring a large
portion of time. For the mutual protection of faculty/academic staff
members and the University, faculty/academic staff members campaigning
as political candidates for state or federal offices shall do so on
their own time. For the period of such candidacy, it is required that
they obtain leaves of absence or continue to work at the University on a
part-time basis. Final determination for such decisions shall rest with
the Board of Trustees.

Leaves of absence are not required of faculty/academic staff members who
become candidates for offices of a temporary or part-time nature, such
as members of a municipal charter revision commission, members of a
local school board, or holders of municipal office.

This policy is intended to safeguard the freedom of speech, thought, and
action of faculty/academic staff and to avoid impairment of the
significant contributions they are capable of making toward improved
local, state, and federal government.\
