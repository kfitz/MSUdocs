**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES (*Cont.*)\
**\
*This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost in 1970.*
:::

The University provides vacation leave to faculty and academic staff
members who are appointed on an annual year basis under the following
conditions:

**Eligibility**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Faculty and academic staff members holding appointments on an annual
    year basis, with more than six months service, are eligible for
    annual vacation leaves. Faculty and academic staff holding academic
    year appointments are not eligible for vacation leave.
2.  Faculty and academic staff members holding appointments on an annual
    year basis receive annual vacation leave equivalent to one month (22
    working days) in twelve months. Proportional allowances are granted
    to appointees with more than six months of service but less than
    twelve. Vacation allowances are granted on July 1 of each year.
    Vacation time is to be charged against this accrual; the accrual
    will be proportionately reduced in the event of
    resignation/termination during the fiscal year or for other
    non-accrual time such as workers\' compensation, long-term
    disability, leave without pay, etc.
3.  Part-time faculty and academic staff members holding appointments
    for fifty percent or more time on an annual year basis receive
    vacation on a proportional basis.
4.  Vacation must be taken during the fiscal year.
5.  Vacation leave may not exceed one month (22 working days) in the
    fiscal year and is not cumulative.

**Scheduling**
:::

Each department is responsible for scheduling vacations in order not to
interfere with the operation of the department and to insure that each
faculty/academic staff member receives the appropriate vacation
allowance during the appointment period. Although the scheduling
preference of faculty and academic staff should be considered, vacations
have to be scheduled to meet the instructional and research requirements
of the department. Units that experience \"slack\" or \"down\" periods
may require that vacations be taken during these times (e.g., December
recess, summer recess, etc.). When practical, faculty/academic staff
members should be informed of such requirements in advance.

**Pay in Lieu of Vacation**

Actual time off from work during the appointment period must be taken in
order to receive compensation for vacation time. Payment in lieu of
vacation may be approved only in case of retirement or termination for
any cause (resignation, death, etc.).

Pay in lieu of vacation shall not exceed payment for one month less
vacation time used during the fiscal year. Neither vacation time nor pay
in lieu of vacation can be granted prior to eligibility for vacation
allowance.

**Transfers**

Unused vacation allowance not exceeding one month will be transferred
with a faculty/academic staff member when the individual transfers from
one position, budget or operating unit to another. If a faculty/academic
staff member is transferred from an instructional staff appointment to a
professional, administrative, or other type of appointment, a transfer
of the balance based on one month less actual vacation days used during
the past fiscal year will be made.

Each department, school, or other administrative unit is responsible for
scheduling vacation time off for faculty/academic staff members,
maintaining vacation usage records, and if a faculty/academic staff
member transfers to another unit, for notifying the faculty/academic
staff member of unused vacation time in writing. A copy of the
notification must be sent to the faculty/academic staff member\'s new
unit.\
