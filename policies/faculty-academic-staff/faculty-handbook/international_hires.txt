**International Hires**

 **IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES\
**\
All faculty and academic staff who are foreign nationals are required to
secure valid immigration status and work authorization before their
expected start date, and maintain valid immigration status and work
authorization throughout the employment.  For the limited purpose of
complying with federal export control regulations, a foreign national
may be required to provide information about his/her citizenship status
depending on the nature of the employment activities.  If subject to
federal export control regulations, the foreign national may also be
required to maintain full-time employment status at MSU, confirm that
his/her permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the
U.S., and sign a confidentiality agreement concerning transfer of
certain technical data.   *See*  22 CFR 125.4.  Prior to beginning work,
all foreign nationals should contact the Office of Export Control and
Trade Sanctions at (517) 432-4499 or  <export@msu.edu>  to ensure
compliance with export control requirements.\
