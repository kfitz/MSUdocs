**Endorsements, Sponsorship, and Advertising**

 Last updated: 4/11/1997

**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on April 11,
1997.*

As a publicly supported institution of higher education, Michigan State
University must be operated in the public trust. Each unit of the
University and every University employee is responsible for protecting
the integrity of the name of the University.

The University recognizes that many of its activities provide potential
sources of revenue through legitimate and worthwhile opportunities for
sponsorship, advertising and promotion of entities and their products
and services. While this revenue can be beneficial to the University
community and in turn to the State of Michigan, the University\'s
reputation and image are paramount and must be protected.

**Endorsements**

No official University publication or statement and no activity carried
out in the name of the University, or by any individual officially
acting on behalf of the University, shall constitute or be construed as
a University endorsement of any commercial product or service. Further,
sponsorship and advertising consistent with this policy are not intended
and shall not be deemed to constitute the University\'s endorsement of
related commercial products or services.

**Sponsorship, Advertising**

The University may extend the following donor and sponsorship
acknowledgment, advertising and promotion opportunities to
non-University entities:

1.  Sports, Performing Arts and Similar Activities. Sponsorship
    recognition and advertising on programs, tickets, uniforms,
    equipment, banners, or other media or fixed or electronic
    recognition panels used in conjunction with University sports,
    performing arts and similar activities which may be attended by the
    public on a complimentary or fee basis.
2.  Public Broadcasting. Sponsorship recognition and advertising on
    public broadcasting programs in accordance with applicable federal
    public broadcasting regulations.
3.  Other Academic Functions
    -   Acknowledgment by the University of donors who provide
        substantial resources which make structures, facilities or
        programs possible, provided that acknowledgment through naming
        opportunities shall be subject to the University\'s policy on
        naming gifts.
    -   Acknowledgment of gifts and grants where such recognition is
        limited to information necessary to identify the donor and the
        nature or purpose of the gift.
    -   Acknowledgment of the cost underwriting of conference and other
        academic programs by a commercial donor, provided that such
        donor acknowledgment is limited to an appropriately modest
        statement of identification.

**Administration**
:::

The Office of the Secretary of the Board of Trustees is responsible for
the implementation of this policy. Requests for interpretations of the
policy shall be referred to that Office. Prior approval of the Board of
Trustees shall be required to erect permanent and substantial structures
for purposes of commercial recognition. Those responsible for any
activity subject to this policy shall exercise reasonable judgment and
taste in the acceptance of sponsorship and advertising and consider
health implications of products to be advertised.\
