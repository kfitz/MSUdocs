**Academic Programs and Policies**

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

The Michigan State University Catalog is comprised of two separate
volumes:   *[Academic
Programs](http://www.reg.msu.edu/ucc/AcademicProgramsUpdated.asp) *and 
*[Descriptions of
Courses](http://www.reg.msu.edu/Courses/Search.asp "course descriptions") *.
Electronic versions of these documents, known as Academic Programs and
COURSES, are updated to reflect approved curricular changes in programs
and policies within several weeks of each Academic Council meeting.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   *Academic Programs*, available from the Office of the Registrar or
    at [http://www.reg.msu.edu](http://www.reg.msu.edu/), describes
    programs of study and the structure of the University and is the
    primary source for University regulations and policies concerning
    instruction. The \"[Undergraduate
    Education](http://undergrad.msu.edu/ "Undergraduate Education")\"
    section states the academic requirements and policies concerning
    undergraduate study; the \"[Graduate
    Education](http://grad.msu.edu/ "Graduate Education")\" section
    refers specifically to graduate study. The \"[General
    Information](http://www.reg.msu.edu/sitemap.asp?Group=1 "Registrar General Info")\"
    section includes topics such as costs, attendance, examinations,
    grading system, integrity of scholarship, student housing, campus
    activities, student organizations and services and the campus.
    Admission and graduation requirements for undergraduate and graduate
    programs in the individual colleges are described in the the
    Colleges, Faculty, and Programs of Study.

-   *[Descriptions of
    Courses](http://www.reg.msu.edu/Courses/Search.asp "course descriptions") *provides
    information about the courses offered by the departments, schools
    and colleges.  Its printed version is used mostly for incoming
    students. Its electronic archive (1970 to 2002) and its current
    version, known on-line as COURSES, are available via the [Office of
    the Registrar](http://www.reg.msu.edu/) or University Curriculum and
    Catalog (<http://www.reg.msu.edu/ucc/ucc.asp>). The COURSES system
    includes complete course request forms and shows courses as pending,
    with interim (college-level) approval, or final (university-level)
    approval.

<!-- -->

-   *Schedule of Courses* is available through the Office of the
    Registrar. A separate print edition of the *Schedule* contains
    summer session offerings, which are also available on the web.
