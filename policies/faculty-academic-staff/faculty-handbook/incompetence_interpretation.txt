**Interpretation of the Term \"Incompetence\" by the University
Committee on Faculty Tenure**

 Last updated: 1/21/2015

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

"Incompetence" is one of several possible causes for the discipline or
dismissal of tenure system faculty members.^1^ Exercising its authority
under sections 4.7.4 and 4.7.5 of the Bylaws for Academic Governance,
the UCFT issued this statement on March 24, 1999 as an interpretation of
the term \"incompetence\" in the Discipline and Dismissal of Tenured
Faculty for Cause policy, one of the \"rules of tenure\" at Michigan
State University.  This Statement was subsequently revised on January
21, 2015.

**Interpretation**

As used in the University policy on Discipline and Dismissal of Tenured
Faculty for Cause, the term \"incompetence" refers to the long-term
failure, after relevant, targeted developmental opportunities have been
provided, to:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  perform required faculty duties as described in the Faculty Rights
    and Responsibilities document, Code of Teaching Responsibility, or
    other University policy; or
2.  meet the relevant unit's written standards and criteria for
    acceptable faculty performance; or
3.  meet the expectations associated with the faculty member's specific
    assignment within his/her unit(s) as delineated in the initial
    appointment letter or other written agreement with the faculty
    member. 
:::

**Expectations for Implementation**

In issuing this interpretation, the University Committee on Faculty
Tenure expects the following will apply:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Dismissal of faculty members for incompetence is an extreme remedy. 
    Absent extraordinary circumstances, other avenues, including the
    disciplinary procedures described in the Discipline and Dismissal of
    Tenured Faculty for Cause policy, must be utilized first to correct
    unacceptable performance before dismissal proceedings are initiated.
2.  Colleagues in departments and schools play a primary role in
    determining if individuals are professionally proficient to serve as
    faculty members at Michigan State University.  The search,
    appointment and tenure processes provide the mechanisms that units
    use to judge whether an individual is suitable for appointment to
    the faculty.  Similarly, units (and especially the department chair)
    have primary responsibility to identify those rare cases where
    faculty members belonging to their unit are no longer performing
    their duties at an acceptable level.  The annual review of faculty
    performance plays a central role in evaluating faculty performance
    and communicating with faculty about the strengths and weaknesses of
    their performance.  The University community expects that each
    department, college, and school has in place a process of annual
    faculty review consistent with the statement on Faculty Review
    issued on February 11, 1997.
3.  Performance reviews in different units use different terms to
    describe levels of performance.  Whatever the specific label,
    unacceptable performance is performance of duties at such an
    unsatisfactory level that it cannot be allowed to continue.  Because
    of the serious consequences of this evaluation, it is recommended
    that faculty colleagues in the department or school (or, if
    necessary, from outside the university) review a unit
    administrator\'s determination that an individual\'s performance is
    unacceptable.  Such a review by faculty colleagues in the department
    or school (e.g., through the established faculty advisory committee)
    is required before a recommendation to initiate dismissal
    proceedings can be made.
4.  Faculty members whose performance is found to be unacceptable must
    reasonably expect to know in writing: \
         a. which standards and criteria they must meet to reach
    acceptable levels of  performance in the relevant unit(s); \
         b. within what time period their performance must be
    remediated; \
         c. the developmental opportunities in which they should engage
    to remediate their performance; and \
         d. the potential consequences if performance does not improve
    to acceptable levels.\
    \
    Faculty members shall be given an opportunity to provide input on
    the developmental opportunities and other specific elements of a
    performance improvement plan before it is implemented.    
5.  The term "long-term" means a period of time of sufficient length
    that the developmental opportunities described above have been
    provided and the period of time provided to improve faculty
    performance has elapsed.  Such a period of time will generally not
    be permitted to extend beyond five full academic years.  
6.  The University Committee on Faculty Tenure\'s statement entitled
    \"Long-Term Disability: An Interpretation of the Tenure Rules\" will
    continue to govern situations involving a tenured faculty member\'s
    physical or mental incapacity to carry out the responsibilities for
    which he or she was appointed.
7.  A faculty member\'s choice of topic or subject for scholarly
    research or creative endeavors is an exercise of her or his academic
    freedom rights.  Particularly in evaluating unpopular,
    unfashionable, or unusual research or creative scholarly activities,
    care must be used to ensure that faculty members\' academic freedom
    rights are respected.  In such cases, external peer review should be
    obtained.
