**[]{#BRP}403(b) BASE RETIREMENT PROGRAM**
:::

Eligibility\
Participation in the 403(b) Base Retirement Program, with the University
contribution, is initially voluntary and required for faculty/academic
staff when certain service and age requirements are met. More
information is available at [403(b) Base Retirement
Program](/benefits/retirement/403b-base.html "403(b) Base Retirement Program").
The general rules follow:

Faculty appointed 50 percent time or more for nine months or more with
the rank of assistant professor, associate professor, professor or
senior research associate may elect immediate participation, with
University contribution, or may defer participation until completing 24
FTE service months and attaining age 35, at which time participation is
mandatory for faculty/academic staff. \
\
A specialist with a probationary or continuing appointment of 50 percent
time or more may elect immediate participation, with University
contribution. A specialist who does not have a probationary or
continuing appointment will become eligible for the University
contribution 24 FTE service months from the date of initial appointment.
Participation for all specialist appointments may be deferred until
completing 24 FTE service months and attaining age 35. \
\
Faculty/academic staff appointed 50 percent time or more for nine months
or more as instructors, lecturers, or assistant instructors become
eligible for the University contribution 24 FTE service months from the
date of initial appointment to an eligible status. (See below for change
in eligibility for research associates). Participation is required for
instructors, lecturers and assistant instructors upon completion of 24
FTE service months and attainment of age 35. Instructor/residents and
instructor/interns are never required to participate. \
\
Effective October 1, 2006, faculty/academic staff appointed 50 percent
time or more for nine months or more as a research associate become
eligible for the University contribution 36 FTE service months from the
date of initial appointment to an eligible status. Participation is
required for research associates upon completion of 36 FTE service
months and attainment of age 35.

Once required participation commences for faculty/academic staff
appointed for nine months or more, the faculty/academic staff member
must continue contributing to the 403(b) Base Retirement Program while
employed at the University.\
\
Faculty/academic staff members appointed 50 percent time or more for
nine months or more previously enrolled in a contributory retirement
program before appointment at MSU or are age 55 or older upon
appointment, may elect immediate participation regardless of rank, with
the University contribution. \
\
Faculty/academic staff may complete the enrollment process in the 403(b)
Base Retirement Program online through the EBS Portal.

Coverage\
The 403(b) Base Retirement Program provides retirement income based upon
the total amount accumulated from the employee\'s contribution, the
University\'s contribution, and any earnings on those amounts over the
period of the working years.

A faculty/academic staff member may commence to draw his/her
accumulation under a variety of payment options after leaving the
University; however, to be considered a retiree from the University,
faculty/academic staff must meet the minimum University retirement
requirements.

The 403(b) Base Retirement Program is fully vested indicating that both
the faculty/academic staff member\'s and the University\'s contributions
are placed directly in the faculty/academic staff member\'s account each
month. In the event the faculty/academic staff member leaves the
University, ownership of the total accumulation is retained by the
faculty/academic staff member. The faculty/academic staff member may
elect to receive an immediate retirement income or may defer the receipt
of his/her retirement income until a later date.

Cost\
The 403(b) Base Retirement Program is financed by a reduction of 5% from
the faculty/academic staff member\'s base salary and a matching
University contribution of 10%.

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  To be considered a retiree from Michigan State University (see the
    [Retiring from the University
    Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retirement.html "Retiring from the University")
    for more detail), a faculty/academic staff member must meet one of
    the following minimum University retirement requirements:
    -   Be at least 62 years of age and have completed 15 years of
        service; or
    -   Have completed 25 years of service at any age.
2.  Access to retiree health coverage (see the [Retiree Benefits
    Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retiree_benefits.html "Retiree Benefits")
    for more detail) is based on the faculty/academic staff member\'s
    Retirement Calculation Date, which is often the employment date but
    may be later: \
    \
    Faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date prior
    to July 1, 2005 and meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements will remain eligible to maintain health and dental
    coverage and receive a University contribution toward the premiums
    based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at
    retirement. \
    \
    For faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on
    or after July 1, 2005 and before July 1, 2010, the University will
    contribute to the lowest cost health plan\'s single rate for which
    the employee/retiree is eligible. (The contribution is based on the
    full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at the time of
    retirement). At retirement, the employee must designate whether the
    employee receives the University contribution or whether the
    contribution is to be split 50/50 between the employee and his/her
    spouse or other eligible individual. This designation is irrevocable
    regardless of circumstance, including returning to work or death.
    The designation of the 50/50 contribution is also non-transferable
    to future spouses or other eligible individuals. \
    \
    Faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on or
    after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for a University contribution to
    health care benefits. Retiree health coverage is available through
    the university at cost. \
    \
    Retirees (their spouse or Other Eligible Individual) age 65 and over
    are required to enroll for Medicare Parts A & B at which time MSU\'s
    health plan coverage is adjusted to a Medicare supplement policy.
    Medicare Part B requires a monthly premium that is not reimbursed by
    MSU. Individuals may contact their local Social Security office for
    information on the monthly premium cost for Medicare Part B.
3.  Faculty/academic staff meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements may continue participation in the employee-paid life
    program after retirement until age 70.
4.  Faculty/academic staff meeting the minimum University retirement
    requirements and who are appointed less than 90% time may be
    eligible to continue receiving the full University contribution
    toward the health and dental plans based on their FTE service
    months; Basic Employer Life, and may continue participation in the
    Course Fee Courtesy program. If you are vested for retirement,
    please contact MSU Human Resources (517)353-4434.

    life plan at the time of retirement and who were enrolled prior to
    July 1, 1976 will receive a \$2,000 life benefit fully paid by the
