**Regulatory Guidelines for Research**

::: {xmlns=""}
**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR (*Cont.*)**
:::

Protection of a research environment for free and unfettered pursuit of
knowledge is an important University responsibility. Infringement on
this freedom must be restricted to those factors which are clearly
essential to the protection of individuals and the public at large.

There exist federal or state laws, regulations and guidelines in several
areas which are designed for this purpose. In addition, the University
community itself acts through its advisory committees and academic
governance bodies to insure that individual research and scholarly
projects incorporate appropriate safeguards.\
