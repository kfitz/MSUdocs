**Student Participation in Academic Governance**

::: {xmlns=""}
**II. ORGANIZATION**\
\
The Bylaws of the Faculty, 1968 provided for both undergraduate and
graduate student participation in the Academic Council and certain
faculty standing committees. In September, 1978, the Board of Trustees
approved the Bylaws for Academic Governance, 1978, to replace the Bylaws
of the Faculty,1968 and the Bylaws for Academic Governance, 1975. The
1978 Bylaws provided for student participation in academic governance
and this involvement continues in the current Bylaws.
:::

Each department, school, center, and institute that has academic
responsibilities or whose work concerns either undergraduate or graduate
students, and all colleges are charged to develop patterns for the
significant involvement of its students in the decision making processes
by which policy is formed. Each group is also required to define the
extent of its student constituency. The students of such a constituency
are responsible for selecting, according to patterns of their own
choice, their representatives in the councils and committees to which
they are party.\
