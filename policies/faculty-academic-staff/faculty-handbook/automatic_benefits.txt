or more. This benefit is effective immediately upon appointment.
:::

Eligible faculty/academic staff members are provided coverage equal to
one year\'s base salary up to a maximum of \$50,000. Beneficiaries are
those designated by the faculty/academic staff member or the same as
designated in the Employee-Paid Life program. If no beneficiary has been

::: {xmlns=""}
Eligibility\
Coverage under the Long-Term Disability Plan is available for
faculty/academic staff appointed full-time for nine months or more who
have been employed for 12 FTE service months. Faculty appointed with
tenure (or on the effective date of the award of tenure) or with the
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams/National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (FRIB/NSCL) continuing appointment status are immediately
covered under this plan. Eligible faculty/academic staff may receive
benefits provided by the Long-Term Disability Plan after 180 days of
continuous disability.
:::

Coverage\
The benefits provide a disabled faculty/academic staff member (as
defined by the master contract) with a monthly income equal to 60% of
the basic monthly salary (minus any workers\' compensation, social
security or auto wage loss benefits, if applicable) up to the limits
defined in the plan. In addition, the program assumes both the
faculty/academic staff member\'s contribution and the University\'s
contribution to the base retirement program for as long as the
individual remains entitled to Long-Term Disability benefits. The plan
provides an annual cost-of-living adjustment and a minimum benefit of
\$50.00 per month.

Cost\
The cost of this benefit is totally paid by the University.

Other Benefit Information\
If the faculty/academic staff member is unable to work due to total
disability and is eligible for benefits under the Long-Term Disability
Plan, a University premium contribution will be continued for the
health, dental and employee-paid life programs for the faculty/academic
staff member during the period of disability benefit payments.

lifetime income in the event of total permanent disability for the
faculty/academic staff member; benefits for dependents subject to
certain age rules; and a lump sum payment at death and monthly income
for qualified survivors. (Foreign Nationals presenting F or J visas may
