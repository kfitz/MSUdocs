**Jury Duty**

::: {xmlns=""}
**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES**
:::

The University recognizes the civic responsibility of faculty/academic
staff members to serve jury duty and makes provision for them to perform
such duty without loss of pay or benefits.

Faculty and academic staff serving on jury duty who are absent from work
for 80 continuous hours or less will receive their regular pay and are
not required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the University. 
They must, however, notify the department chairperson/school director of
the call to jury duty as soon as it is received.

Faculty and academic staff serving on jury duty who are absent from work
for more than 80 continuous hours must notify the department
chairperson/school director of the call to jury duty as soon as it is
received and are required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the
Payroll Office.  The faculty/academic staff member will receive the
difference between the pay received from the court and normal base pay.

In all cases, the faculty/academic staff member is expected to report
for regular University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at
court.

Full cooperation is expected between the faculty/academic staff member,
unit administrator and department(s) involved to insure minimal
disruption in the instructional and service responsibilities of the
unit.\
