**Operating Principles of the Tenure System**

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was revised by the Board of Trustees on May 18,
2007 and on April 24, 2009.*

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Probationary appointment periods for tenure purposes are calculated
    from August 16 of the calendar year in which the appointment is
    effective.
2.  A faculty member granted a leave of absence for six to twelve months
    will have the probationary appointment period extended
    appropriately.  See \"Extending the Reappointment/Promotion/Tenure
    Review Timeline\" for additional reasons and procedures for
    extending the probationary appointment period.
3.  A faculty member who is not to be recommended for reappointment by
    the department chairperson and dean must be so notified in writing
    by the department chairperson by December 15 preceding the
    expiration of the appointment. Copies of the notification are to be
    sent to the dean and provost. Upon written request of the faculty
    member, the administrative unit making the decision shall transmit
    in writing the reasons for not recommending further appointment.
4.  If a faculty member is not given proper notification, as stated in
    3., an extension of one year is automatic, and the faculty member
    shall consider this arrangement as official notification of
    separation from the University at the end of the one-year extension.
5.  A tenure system faculty member who is not reappointed or resigns may
    not be appointed in the tenure system, except as approved by the
    University Committee on Faculty Tenure upon written request by the
    faculty member, department/school and college.
6.  A Foreign National holding non-immigrant status may be appointed
    within the tenure system; however, he/she may not be appointed with
    tenure unless (a) he/she has acquired permanent resident status or
    U.S. citizenship or (b) he/she enters into and complies with the
    terms of a *Faculty Tenure Policy Exemption Agreement* ^1 ^approved
    by the Provost.
7.  Questions about the interpretation of the tenure rules are referred
    to the University Committee on Faculty Tenure. The Committee renders
    a decision and communicates it to the president, the provost or
    other appropriate administrative official. In every case, final
    decision rests with the Board of Trustees.  The University Committee
    on Faculty Tenure also considers the resolution of tenure
    issues/problems arising from situations not covered in the tenure
    rules and proposes solutions to the Provost.  As appropriate, the
    Provost may recommend new policies or policy revisions to
    appropriate academic governance bodies.  Changes in the tenure rules
    require action by the Board of Trustees.
8.  Tenure at Michigan State University resides in the University and
    tenured faculty have \"tenure in the university.\"  (See
    \"Principles of Faculty Reassignment\").

**Footnote ** **:**

^1 ^In those situations where the Foreign National chooses not to
execute a *Faculty Tenure Policy Exemption Agreement* but has otherwise
been endorsed by the Provost as having met all of the requirements for
promotion and tenure, he/she will be placed on a fixed term appointment
or have his/her appointment period extended on an annual basis,
whichever is appropriate, until permanent resident status or U.S.
citizenship is granted, at which time a tenure recommendation will be
made to the Board of Trustees.\
