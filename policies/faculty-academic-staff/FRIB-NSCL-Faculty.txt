===============================================================================================

Last updated: 5/28/16

This document contains employment policies specifically related to
employment as a FRIB/NSCL Faculty member (FRIB/NSCL Faculty) in the
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams in multi-year fixed term appointments.
This document does not replace or modify other existing University
policies, which remain in effect for all University employees. In
circumstances when the document is silent on an issue, the Laboratory
adheres to the corresponding policy contained in the Faculty Handbook.

**I. Definitions**

A. \"FRIB/NSCL Faculty\" hold multi-year fixed term appointments and
will normally be jointly appointed in the FRIB and an appropriate
academic unit, e.g., Physics and Astronomy, Chemistry, Engineering,
etc., at the ranks of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and
Professor.

B. \"Laboratory Faculty\" is the combined group of FRIB/NSCL Faculty and
tenure system faculty who hold joint appointments in the FRIB and an
academic unit.

**II. Role and Responsibility**

A. FRIB/NSCL Faculty are expected to make high quality contributions to
research, teaching, student mentoring and service in support of the
FRIB/NSCL mission and the teaching goals of their academic unit. The
teaching load of FRIB/NSCL Faculty in their academic unit will normally
be equal to the teaching load of the FRIB/NSCL tenure system faculty in
the respective unit, thus reducing the average teaching load of the
Laboratory faculty.

B. Research conducted by FRIB/NSCL Faculty is expected to be of
excellent quality as determined by peer review and to be directed toward
further enhancement of the national role of the FRIB and its long-term
objectives.

C. FRIB/NSCL Faculty will participate in laboratory faculty meetings and
will have the same voting rights as tenure system faculty at the FRIB.

D. FRIB/NSCL Faculty may act as senior investigators on sponsored
research projects with approvals according to applicable University
procedures and policies and may act as advisors to graduate students in
thesis research.

E. Consistent with the Bylaws for Academic Governance, full time
FRIB/NSCL Faculty who have served at least three consecutive years may
be elected to an academic governance body, with the exception of the
University Committee on Faculty Tenure, as a representative of any unit
in which the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member holds a joint appointment.

F. The rights and responsibilities of FRIB/NSCL Faculty in their
academic unit may vary and will be defined within the bylaws of the
respective academic unit.

**III. Appointment Basis**

A. FRIB/NSCL Faculty are appointed on a full time, annual year (12
months) basis with salaries paid in 12 installments on the last working
day of each month. An academic year (AY, 9 month) appointment may be
recommended by the Laboratory Director based on program needs and the
specific duties and responsibilities of the position. FRIB/NSCL Faculty
appointed on an academic year basis are to be available for University
duties from August 16 through May 15. The total AY appointment salary is
paid over the duty period, on the last working day of each month.

B. Assistant Professors are appointed initially for a four-year fixed
term and may be reappointed for a three-year fixed term. If not promoted
to the rank of Associate Professor at the conclusion of the second fixed
term appointment, the individual is ineligible for an additional
reappointment.\
An initial appointment as Associate Professor or Professor is normally
for a fixed term of four years but may vary from 3 to 5 years as
recommended by the Laboratory Director. The Laboratory Director may
recommend a rolling fixed term five-year appointment for an initial
appointment as Professor.  Upon promotion to Associate Professor or
Professor, the appointment will be for a rolling fixed term five-year
appointment.

**IV. Annual Performance Review**

A. The annual performance review of FRIB/NSCL Faculty will be conducted
according to the Laboratory Faculty Annual Performance Review Procedure.
The unit administrator conducting the performance evaluation will
receive input from a Faculty Review Advisory Committee (FRAC). As
applicable, the FRAC will also make a recommendation regarding
continuation of a rolling fixed term appointment. Additionally, the unit
administrator will seek advice from the Department Chair of the academic
unit in which the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member holds a joint appointment
or appropriate administrators in other units in which the faculty member
has responsibilities.

**V. Reappointment and/or Promotion Review**

A. At the beginning of each academic year the Laboratory Director will
request all FRIB/NSCL Faculty members at the rank of Assistant Professor
and Associate Professor and all Professors without a rolling fixed term
appointment to submit a file of materials in support of reappointment
(for FRIB/NSCL faculty without a rolling fixed term appointment) and/or
promotion. The materials are prepared according to written guidelines
and must include the name of the senior faculty member who serves as the
faculty mentor.

B. A Reappointment and Promotion Committee (RPC) is convened by the
Laboratory Director and consists of all Laboratory Faculty at a rank
higher than those FRIB/NSCL faculty under consideration for
reappointment or promotion. For Professors, faculty of equal rank will
constitute the RPC. The RPC reviews the status and progress of each
FRIB/NSCL Faculty member under consideration (see A., above).  For
Professors without a rolling appointment, the Laboratory Director has
the option to form a subcommittee or to call for a vote by the RPC on
reappointment for a rolling fixed term appointment of 5 years.

C. An RPC subcommittee must be formed to consider the reappointment
and/or promotion of FRIB/NSCL faculty whose fixed term appointment will
expire in two years. For others, an RPC subcommittee will be formed upon
an affirmative vote of 25% or more of the RPC or by request of the
Laboratory Director. Each RPC subcommittee will be composed of faculty
members of higher rank than the candidate (equal rank for Professors),
including three Laboratory faculty members and one additional member
from the appropriate academic unit. In addition, the mentor of the
FRIB/NSCL faculty member considered for reappointment or promotion will
be a member of the subcommittee.

D. The RPC subcommittee informs the candidate in writing about its
procedures, rules and guidelines. The criteria and standards for tenure
system faculty in the respective academic unit should be considered
taking into account that the major fraction of the appointment is held
at FRIB/NSCL. The timeline for RPC actions should parallel that for
tenure system faculty in the respective academic unit.

E. When an RPC subcommittee has completed its deliberations, a
recommendation regarding reappointment or promotion will be provided to
the RPC. A vote shall be taken by the RPC and its recommendation shall
then be forwarded through line management successively to the Director
and to the Provost or designee for appropriate action.

**VI. Grievance Procedure**

A. Any FRIB/NSCL Faculty member may initiate a grievance alleging a
violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of existing policies or
established practices, applicable in a department of the Laboratory, the
Laboratory as a whole, or the University. Informal resolution of a
grievance must be attempted through discussion with appropriate
Laboratory administrators, prior to initiating a formal grievance.

B. In the event that the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved
informally, the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member may request resolution using
the formal procedures specified for the FRIB/NSCL Continuing Appointment
System.

**VII. Expiration or Termination of Appointment**

A. The University has no obligation to provide reappointment or
extension of an FRIB/NSCL Faculty appointment beyond the current end
date. Except in the case of dismissal for cause (see paragraph VII.D.),
a written notice of at least 12 months will be provided prior to
expiration or termination of the appointment.

B. In the event that the operation and research funds of the FRIB/NSCL
are terminated or drastically cut it may be necessary to reduce or
eliminate FRIB/NSCL Faculty positions. In this case and after review by
the Provost or designee, FRIB/NSCL Faculty appointments may be allowed
to expire at the end of their current term.

C. FRIB/NSCL Faculty appointments may be allowed to expire at the end of
their current term for failure to meet the responsibilities as defined
in Sections II.A. and II.B. The determination of inadequate performance
will consider a period of at least two years. Based on the annual
performance reviews, the Laboratory Director will ask for a
recommendation by a majority of Laboratory Faculty who are of higher
rank than the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member. For professors, Laboratory
Faculty of equal rank will make the recommendation. The final decision
is made by the Laboratory Director.

D. FRIB/NSCL Faculty may be dismissed immediately for cause including
but not limited to (1) intellectual dishonesty; (2) acts of
discrimination, including harassment, prohibited by law or University
policy; (3) acts of moral turpitude substantially related to the fitness
of faculty members to engage in teaching, research, service/outreach
and/or administration; (4) theft or misuse of University property; (5)
incompetence; (6) refusal to perform reasonable assigned duties; (7) use
of professional authority to exploit others; (8) violation of University
policy substantially related to performance of faculty responsibilities;
and (9) violation of law(s) substantially related to the fitness of
faculty members to engage in teaching, research, service/outreach and/or
administration.  Dismissal for cause will follow Section 2.0 in the
Procedures for the Dismissal of CA Staff for Cause.

**VIII. Professional Development**

A. FRIB/NSCL Faculty members are encouraged to take advantage of special
conferences, seminars, colloquia, and other short-term activities and
programs which will add to or update their professional knowledge and
skills. Attendance at professional meetings and participation in
programs which are held outside of the immediate geographic area require
the approval of the appropriate FRIB Division Director and completion of
Travel Authorization forms.

B. Extended release time for assignment to scholarly duties may be
granted to FRIB/NSCL Faculty with six or more years of service to the
University in order to enhance professional competency and for scholarly
pursuit. Such activities are intended for the mutual benefit of the
Laboratory, the University and the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member. The purpose
is to encourage academic and institutional revitalization by providing
sustained time for research/creative activities; development of new
courses or programs; acquisition of expanded and/or new qualifications
and skills; contribution to unit plans to improve and/or refocus
instructional, research, or public service activities in accordance with
the missions of the University. Extended release time for assignment to
scholarly duties is not granted automatically and must be approved by
the Laboratory Director in consultation with the Department Chair of the
academic unit in which the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member holds a joint
appointment. Extended release time must be requested in writing by the
FRIB/NSCL Faculty member and directed to the Laboratory Director.
Requests must include a detailed description of the purposes,
objectives, and scholarly and research activities of the proposed
extended release time. The plan should indicate how the objectives and
accomplishments of the extended release time will advance the interests
and capabilities of the FRIB/NSCL Faculty member for fulfilling the
aims, objectives and goals of the Laboratory, academic unit, college
and/or University. Extended release time for assignment to scholarly
duties for more than six months requires approval of the Provost or
designee. Funding for extended release time and assignment to scholarly
duties is provided by the unit.
