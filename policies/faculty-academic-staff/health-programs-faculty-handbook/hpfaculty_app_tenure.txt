**VIII. Movement from HP Faculty Appointment System to Tenure System**

An appointment in the Health Programs Faculty Appointment system does
not preclude an individual from applying for a tenure system position
for which the individual is qualified. Similarly, previous service as an
HP faculty member is not a prerequisite for a tenure system position.

When an HP faculty member accepts a position in the tenure system,
his/her responsibilities may change and total salary and rank may also
change. Rank is associated with criteria that may differ based on the
appointment system, e.g., HP or tenure system. The base salary should
not change, but would be specified in the letter of offer, as would the
practice component portion of the salary.\
