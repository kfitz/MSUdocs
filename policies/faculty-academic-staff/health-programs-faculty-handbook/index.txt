Health Programs Faculty Appointment System Handbook {#health-programs-faculty-appointment-system-handbook xmlns=""}
===================================================

This Handbook describes an appointment system for clinician faculty
members appointed on a paid basis in the Colleges of Human, Osteopathic,
Veterinary Medicine and Nursing. Faculty members appointed in the basic
biological or behavioral science areas within the medical colleges are
not appointed in the HP system.

The Health Programs Faculty Appointment System (HP) is predicated on the
need of the medical and nursing colleges of Michigan State University to
expand and enhance their programs in clinical education, patient care
service, and clinical research through a planned expansion of patient
care services and community outreach. In order to meet the personnel
needs of these missions, it is essential that the medical and nursing
colleges gradually increase the number of clinician faculty resources
supporting each of these essential functions. Given the declining
general fund base support for these colleges, essential growth in
faculty resources must be supported through a combination of patient
care income and other clinically and service related revenues.

The medical and nursing colleges of Michigan State University are
committed to the tenure system as the basic faculty appointment track of
the University. The colleges of medicine and nursing would not exist as
academic entities without a sufficient number of tenure system faculty
to provide continuous support to both academic and clinical programs.
The Health Programs Faculty Appointment System is a supplement to the
tenure system, which requires teaching, research and clinical service in
the medical and nursing colleges.
