**XI. Professional Development Leave**

A professional development leave is intended for the mutual benefit of
the University and the faculty member granted the leave. The purpose is
to encourage academic and institutional revitalization by providing
sustained time for acquisition of expanded or new qualifications and
skills; development of courses or clerkships, or instructional efforts
devoted to graduate nursing students, residents or fellows; contribution
to academic unit plans to improve and/or refocus instructional,
scholarly, or public service activities in accordance with the mission
of the University. A professional development leave is not granted
automatically. Each request for a leave must include a detailed
description outlining the purposes, objectives and activities of the
leave and normally is submitted six months in advance of the planned
starting date of the leave. Availability of local professional
development assignments is at the discretion of the unit administrator.
This could include assignment to research laboratories on the Michigan
State University campus.

### A. Eligibility
:::

A leave shall not be granted until the faculty member has completed six
years of service from the date of the initial HP appointment or from the
ending date of the previous professional development leave. Service
shall be interpreted to include those activities of interest to and
supported by the University, regardless of the source of financial
support. All leaves of absence shall be excluded in determining years of
service for a professional development leave.

Requests for service as a fixed term faculty member prior to an HP
appointment to be counted toward a professional development leave are
handled on a case by case basis. The chairperson (Associate Dean for
Academic and Clinical Affairs in the College of Nursing) will make a
recommendation to the Dean after evaluating the faculty member\'s
request. The Dean will make the final decision regarding whether to
credit service as a fixed term faculty member toward a professional
development leave.

The length of leaves shall not be extended on the basis of more than six
years of service since the previously compensated leave. Appropriate
applications for a full year of leave with reduced pay normally have
precedence over one semester leaves with full pay.

### B. Length and Salary of Professional Development Leave
:::

For Health Programs Faculty on annual appointments, professional
development leaves are of two types:

a\. Up to six months with no reduction in pay

b\. Twelve months with a fifty percent reduction in base salary

For the Health Programs faculty on academic year appointments,
professional development leaves are of two types:

a\. One semester with no reduction in pay.

b\. Two semesters with a fifty percent reduction in the academic year
salary. (Payments distributed over the duty period, August 16 -- May
15.)

Since faculty members in the HP appointment system normally receive a
base salary and a practice component of the salary (except in CVM and
CON), it is the decision of the appropriate unit administrator whether
or not to guarantee the practice component of salary during a
professional development leave.

### C. Professional Development Leaves for Administrators
:::

For HP faculty with administrative assignments, the following options
are available:

1.  Three months once in every three years with full pay, initially
    after six years of service in the HP appointment system, which
    includes at least three years of administrative service.
2.  Six months with no reduction in pay after at least six years of
    service in the HP appointment system, which includes at least three
    years of administrative service, or since the previous professional
    development leave. Such calculations are begun on the date of
    full‐time appointment and must include at least three years in
    administrative positions exclusive of compensated leaves.
3.  Professional development leave eligibility following the return to
    regular faculty duties requires six years of service in the HP
    appointment system since the completion of the leave referenced in
    either a. or b. above. Up to three years credit for service between
    the date of full‐time employment or the end date of the leave
    immediately preceding the administrative assignment, whichever is
    later, and the beginning date of the administrative position may be
    applied toward this requirement only if the last professional
    development leave as an administrator was a three month leave.
