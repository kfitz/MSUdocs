**XIV. Retirement and Benefits Programs**

**A.  ** **Retirement Programs**

Faculty members become eligible for the University contribution to the
403(b) Base Retirement Program upon a benefits eligible appointment at
50% time or more in the Health Programs Faculty Appointment System.
Participation in the 403(b) Base Retirement Program is initially
voluntary; enrollment is mandatory at age 35 and 24 full‐time equivalent
service months. Participation in the 403(b) Supplemental Retirement
Program and/or 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan is optional at any
time. The 403(b) Base Retirement Program is financed by a reduction of
5% from the HP faculty member\'s base salary and a matching University
contribution of 10%. The University will only contribute retirement
benefits on the base component of an HP faculty member\'s salary, up to
the IRS salary cap. The University will not contribute retirement
benefits on the HSRC or IDP component of the faculty member\'s salary.

**B. Other Benefit Programs**

HP faculty are eligible for the benefit programs described in
the [Faculty and Academic Staff Retirement and Benefits section of
the *Faculty
Handbook* ](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/7Section-Benefits.html "faculty handbook").

Enrollment in optional benefits, e.g., health coverage, must take place
within 30 days of the initial HP faculty appointment, during an open
enrollment period, or in some cases by furnishing evidence of
insurability.\
