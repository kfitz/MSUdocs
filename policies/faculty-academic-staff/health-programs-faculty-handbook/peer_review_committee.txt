**VII. Guidelines for Academic Unit Peer Review Committee Composition**

Each academic unit is charged to establish procedures so that its
faculty can provide advice to the academic administrator regarding
recommendations for various academic personnel actions, e.g., merit pay,
appointment, reappointment, and promotion. The following are general
guidelines for the composition of peer review committees.

1\. Eligibility for membership on academic unit peer review committees is
limited to faculty members (both in the tenure system and in the HP
system) appointed at Michigan State University and/or at peer higher
educational institutions. Refer to individual unit bylaws for the
composition of the academic unit peer review committee, e.g., Department
Promotion and Tenure Committee, Departmental Executive Committee, etc.

2\. The composition of an academic unit peer review committee should be
representative of that unit's diverse academic interests. Additionally,
unit selection procedures should include provisions to encourage
participation by women and minority faculty members.\
