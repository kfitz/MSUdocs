Health Programs Appointment System Salary Program**

HP faculty salaries are generally made up of two components: base
salary, determined with reference to relevant professional markets, plus
an additional component derived from funds generated by clinical
services. This latter component has been labeled historically as the
Health Service Related Component (HSRC). In some cases, base salaries
are determined in part by the receipt of contract and grant funds. Base
salary and clinical income limits are determined by the relevant
department chair(s) with oversight by the relevant dean\'s office(s).
Adjustments in base salaries are determined on a merit basis.
