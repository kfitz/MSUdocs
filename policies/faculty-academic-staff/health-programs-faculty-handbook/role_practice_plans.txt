**XVI. The Role of Practice Plans**

The MSU Health Team Practice Plan for the Colleges of Human and
Osteopathic Medicine and the College of Nursing, provides a common
framework within which professional fee income generated by faculty
members of the three colleges is managed. The MSU Health Team and the
Veterinary Medicine Practice Plans are means to supplement basic support
for the programs for the colleges; sustain and enhance faculty
incentives to engage in patient care services which benefit education
programs, the public and the professional development of the faculty;
and make it financially feasible to recruit and retain highly capable
faculty necessary to develop and sustain quality programs.  This plan
was approved by the Board of Trustees in July 1976 and revised on March
31, 1983 and February 10, 1995.\
