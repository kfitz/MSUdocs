**IV. Criteria for Establishing Health Programs Faculty Positions**

The establishment of Health Programs faculty positions requires the
following documentation:

a.  A need for a clinician faculty position exists in a department or
other unit associated with the medical and nursing colleges.

b\. Sources(s) of funding to support the position through discretionary,
variable and non‐continuing funds, grants, and/or practice revenues. HP
faculty may temporarily be supported on general funds as needed to
compensate for service for which the University is obligated to the
individual.

c\. A significant portion of the responsibilities of the position are
normally in clinical activities such as patient care, clinical and
pre-clinical teaching, scholarship and institutional service.

Health Programs Faculty positions are established on the recommendation
of the appropriate academic unit administrator and approved by the dean
or separately reporting director.\
