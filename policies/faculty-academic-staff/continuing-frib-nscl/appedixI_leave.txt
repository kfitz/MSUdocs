**Appendix I: Leave Policies**

::: {xmlns=""}
A leave of absence, with or without pay, may be granted to CA staff
members. Recommendations for leaves of absences originate in the
Laboratory and must be reviewed successively by the Director and the
Provost or designee, who makes the final decision. Leaves usually do not
extend beyond one year.
:::

Leaves of absence, other than for short-term disability, parental or for
military service, are not granted automatically but are intended for the
mutual benefit of the University and the CA staff member. Leaves will
not be granted unless satisfactory arrangements are made in advance to:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  carry on the Laboratory duties of the CA staff member
2.  fulfill obligations to graduate students whose programs or theses
    are being directed by the CA staff member, and
3.  fulfill obligations to committee assignments
:::

Specific dates for the leave must be specified in the request and should
be made as far in advance as possible.

A CA staff member who without good cause fails to return to the
University within a reasonable time (generally 5 calendar days) after a
leave of absence shall forfeit rights to further employment and shall be
considered as having resigned. In such circumstances, the following
procedures shall apply in lieu of the Dismissal for Cause procedures.

The Provost or designee shall inform the CA staff member that the
failure to return may be treated as a resignation and provide the person
with an opportunity to respond. If the CA Staff member cannot be
contacted after a reasonable effort, the Provost or designee shall
proceed on the basis of the information available. The Provost or
designee shall decide whether the failure to return shall be considered
a resignation. The CA staff member may initiate a grievance under the
FRIB/NSCL Grievance Procedure.

**1. Leaves of Absence Without Pay**

Leaves of absence without pay may be granted on recommendation of the
Department Head with the approval of the Director and Provost or
designee. Specific dates for the leave must be specified in the request
and should be made as far in advance as possible so that Laboratory
program will not be interrupted. Such leaves usually do not extend
beyond one year.

CA staff members should contact MSU Human Resources to make arrangements
for continuation of their benefit programs.

**2. Other Leaves**

Requests for Military Service Leaves, Short-Term Disability (medical)
Leaves (including FMLA leave), Parental Leaves, Funeral/Bereavement
Leave, Jury Duty Leave, and Continuation of Benefits While on Unpaid
Leave of Absence are governed by the corresponding policies located in
the Faculty Handbook.

**3. Vacation Leave**

The University provides vacation leave to CA staff members whose
appointments are on an annual basis under the following conditions:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   CA staff members holding appointments on an annual basis, with more
    than six months service, are eligible for annual vacation leaves.
-   CA staff members holding appointments on an annual basis receive
    annual vacation leave of 22 working days each year. Proportional
    allowances are granted to appointees with more than six months of
    service but less than twelve. Vacation allowances are granted on
    July 1 of each year.
-   Part time employees appointed for 6 months or more at 50% time or
    higher accrue vacation on a proportional basis.
:::

Scheduling

The Laboratory is responsible for scheduling vacations in order not to
interfere with its research program and to insure that each CA staff
member receives the appropriate vacation allowance during the
appointment period. The scheduling preferences of CA staff will be
considered, but vacations must be scheduled in accordance with the
requirements of the Laboratory\'s program.

Carry Forward

All unused vacation up to a cumulative maximum of 22 days will be
carried forward from one fiscal year to the next. Time thus carried
forward will be used before time granted in the new fiscal year.
Vacation leave which has been carried forward is not eligible for
payment in lieu of vacation.

Pay in Lieu of Vacation

Payment in lieu of vacation may be approved in cases of retirement or
termination in accordance with University policy.

\
Vacation time provided in the current fiscal year which has not been
used at the end of the fiscal year due to the request by the Laboratory
will be compensated for at the rate of 0.2% of the annual salary per
unused day.

\
To be eligible for payment in lieu of vacation, a staff member must
maintain and periodically submit records of her/his working schedule,
such records to be maintained in a format acceptable to the Laboratory
Administration documenting the basis of the in-lieu-of-vacation payment.
Neither vacation time nor pay in lieu of vacation can be granted prior
to eligibility for vacation allowance. Payments for vacation not used
(at the request of the Laboratory) in any fiscal year will be made in
the first month of the following fiscal year.\
