Continuing Appointment System of FRIB-NSCL

**12. Professional Development**

::: {xmlns=""}
**12.1.** The Laboratory encourages the professional development of its
staff. CA staff members are encouraged to take advantage of special
conferences, seminars, colloquia, and other short-term activities and
programs that will enhance their job-related professional knowledge and
skills. Attendance at programs held during scheduled work hours or at
programs that would affect the operation of the work unit must be
approved in advance by their line manager. Attendance at professional
meetings and participation in programs that are held outside of the
immediate area further require the approval of the Department Head to
arrange for Travel Authorization and for possible reimbursement of
expenses. As funds for financial assistance are limited, the extent of
reimbursement will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
:::

**12.1.1**. All CA staff members are eligible to enroll in formal
courses on either a degree or non-degree basis, subject to the
limitation that a staff member on a full-time appointment may carry no
more than five credit hours at one time. In the case of job-related
courses, flexible working schedules can be arranged with the Department
Head in order to attend classes given during normal working hours.
Requests for release time will be considered on a case-by-case basis and
approved by the Director. Tuition expenses for job related courses may
also be reimbursed by the Laboratory, subject to availability of funds
and if recommended by the Department Head and approved by the Director
in advance of registering for the course.

**12.2**. CA Staff members are eligible to apply for a temporary
reassignment to scholarly duties that enhance the research activities
and capabilities of both the individual staff member and the laboratory
group research program. Reassignment to scholarly duties for
professional development is not granted automatically but is intended
for the mutual benefit of the University and the CA staff member.
Reassignment will not be granted unless satisfactory arrangements are
made in advance to:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   carry on the Laboratory duties of the CA staff member
-   fulfill obligations to graduate students whose programs or theses
    are being directed by the CA staff member, and fulfill obligations
    to committee assignments
-   Specific dates for the reassignment must be specified in the request
    and are approved by the Director.
