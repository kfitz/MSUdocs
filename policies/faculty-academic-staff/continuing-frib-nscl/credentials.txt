Continuing Appointment System of FRIB-NSCL

**03. Credentials**

The duties and responsibilities performed by CA employees are of
significance and strategic importance to academic unit roles and
purposes but do not necessarily require the Ph.D. or other terminal
qualifying degree. Normally CA positions require a Master\'s degree
and/or other specialized qualifications in the applicable discipline or
profession. The actual requirements may vary with the specific
functional area. The attainment of a particular degree does not
guarantee appointment in the CA system.\
