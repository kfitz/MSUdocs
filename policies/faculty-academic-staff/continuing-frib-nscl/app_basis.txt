2.1 Appointments in the CA System may be on a full-time (100%), annual
year (12 month) basis or part time.  Part-time probationary or
continuing appointments must be for 50% time or greater and may be
recommended at the discretion of the Laboratory Director
(\"Director\").  A recommendation to change the percent of employment
requires mutual consent of the employee and the Director (note:  this
provision does not apply to actions taken pursuant to Sections 10 and 11
of this Handbook).   Academic year (9 month) appointments may be
recommended at the discretion of the Director.

2.2 A Foreign National holding non-immigrant status may be appointed
within the CA system; however, he/she may not be given continuing
appointment status in the CA system unless (a) he/she has acquired
permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship or (b) he/she enters into
and complies with the terms of a FRIB/NSCL Continuing Appointment
Agreement approved by the Provost.
