Continuing Appointment System of FRIB-NSCL

**05. Joint Appointments**

Subject to the concurrence of the Director and the relevant
administrators of academic units (departments, schools, and residential
or other non-departmentally organized colleges), a CA staff member may
be jointly appointed between the Laboratory and an academic unit.
Specific duties and responsibilities must be stated clearly in advance.
Such appointments must be recommended using MSU\'s Multiple Appointment
Memorandum. Such appointments do not require a tenure system vacancy,
nor do they imply a commitment to a future tenure system appointment.\
