**Appendix VIII: Annual Review and Salary Determination**

::: {xmlns=""}
Prior to submitting salary adjustment recommendations, each Department
Head shall annually review the contributions of the CA staff members in
her/his department. This review will be based on (a) a review of an
evaluation folder prepared by the staff member; (b) opinions solicited
from other members of the Laboratory; and (c) other sources of relevant
information. The Department Head will formulate salary adjustment
recommendations based on these reviews. Based on an assessment of these
recommendations and University salary guidelines, the Director will make
salary recommendations to the Provost or designee.
:::

Each CA staff member shall have the right to receive a written
explanation of her/his salary increase from the Department Head and
Director, if so requested.\
