Continuing Appointment System of FRIB-NSCL

**04. Fixed Term Appointments**

::: {xmlns=""}
Fixed-term appointments are made outside the Continuing Appointment
System. Individuals may be appointed on a fixed-term basis at any rank
and in any professional area. All fixed-term appointments have a
specific termination date. The University has no obligation to provide
reappointment or extension of a fixed-term appointment beyond the ending
date. Such appointments do not convey Continuing Status at any time
irrespective of the number of times the appointment is renewed. \
