**Appendix II: Interruption/Compensation Program**

::: {xmlns=""}
CA staff members may be called during their non-scheduled working hours
in the case of emergency or operational need. A compensation schedule
has been developed to pay individuals for this interruption. To see a
copy of the current compensation schedule, see the Personnel Coordinator
or the Laboratory Administrator. This program must be reauthorized by
the Provost or designee periodically.
:::

To receive compensation for such interruptions, a form is initiated by
the caller, who provides pertinent details about the call. The caller
signs the form, and provides it to the individual who was called for
their signature. The Department Head of the individual who was called
must also sign the form, and turn it in to the Personnel Coordinator for
payment processing.

Payment for the Interruption Compensation Program is processed monthly.\
