    (MESA).](http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ua_mesact_3103_7.pdf "Michigan Employment Security Act")                     
-   Section 43 (1) (i) of the MESA was amended April 11, 1976, to read
    as follows: \"Except as otherwise provided in Section 42 (6) the
    term \"employment\" shall not include:
    -   Service performed in the employ of a school, college, or
        university, if the service is performed by a person who is
        primarily a student at the school, college or university. For
        the purpose of this subsection a person is deemed to be
        \"primarily a student\" if the individual is enrolled in an
        institution, is pursuing a course of study for academic credit
        and while thus enrolled normally works 30 hours or less per week
        for the institution.

**Severe Weather**                  \
In the event of severe weather conditions, only student employees whose
services are required for maintenance, food service and other essential
operations should report to work. Supervisors must advise student
employees of reporting requirements at the time they are hired. Students
should be paid at their normal rate for the hours they actually work
during a period of severe weather. Students who do not work will not be
paid.

**Driver And Chauffeur Licenses**               

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
-   There are several student employee job descriptions that require
    driver and/or chauffeur licenses for student employees. All
    departments should review the duties being performed by their
    student employees as far as driving motor vehicles is concerned and,
    where necessary, require that student employees obtain a chauffeur
    license. In addition, when recruiting to fill vacancies,
    requisitions should clearly state those instances where chauffeur
    licenses are required.
-   Where an employee is required to operate a motor vehicle for the
    purpose of transporting merchandise or persons on a regular basis,
    that employee should be required to possess a chauffeur license. A
    chauffeur license should be required where a primary responsibility
    is the operation of a motor vehicle with a seating capacity of
    twelve or more persons or which is regularly involved in the
    delivery of goods and materials on the public highway.

**Summer Hiring**                  

-   An individual may be considered a student employee if s/he has been
    assigned a student number, has attended AOP, and/or has been
    admitted/readmitted for fall semester, and is enrolled for summer or
    fall semester classes.
-   A student hired for summer semester cannot begin working until the
    semester officially starts if s/he was not enrolled spring semester,
    or, if a new student, until they have gone through AOP and have
    signed up for fall classes.
-   The procedure for processing student employees will be the same as
    during the academic year.
-   Students who are to continue working during the summer in the same
    job they held spring semester do not need to be reprocessed for
    employment.
-   Students may work up to 40 hours per week during summer semester.
    However, departments will only be reimbursed for 29 hours per week
    for Work-Study students.
-   Students must be paid time and one-half for all hours worked in
    excess of 40 hours per week. The additional straight hours are paid
    by the department where the hours were reported and the overtime
    premium is split proportionately between the units based on how many
    total hours they have worked in each department.
-   A student who graduates or is not returning to classes Summer or
    Fall Semester may stay on Student Employee payroll until the second
    week of June(exact date will be communicated via MSU Pathways).
-   A student employed on the Graduate Assistant and Student payrolls
    may not exceed 40 hours a week for all students including
