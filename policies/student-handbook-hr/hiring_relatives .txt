**Hiring a Relative - Student Employment**

::: {xmlns=""}
The following statement constitutes the University\'s policy concerning
the Employment of Relatives as it applies to students:
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Standards for employment and promotion of student employees at
    Michigan State University shall consist of ability, qualifications
    for the position, and performance. Relationship (meaning a person
    connected by blood or affinity) to another individual employed by
    the University shall not constitute a bar to hiring or promotion;
    provided, however, that no employee shall be assigned to a unit or
    department under the direct supervision or control of a relative.
    Employment of relatives in the same unit or department or under the
    same supervisor is authorized only with prior written approval of
    the head of the unit or department and the Office of the Provost
    (for academic departments) or the Office of the Vice President for
    Finance & Operations (for non-academic departments).
-   A student and a related regular full-time (non-student) employee may
    be employed in the same unit or department or under the same
    supervisor if prior written approval is obtained.
-   The employment of related students in the same unit or department is
    permitted if prior written approval is obtained.
:::

NOTE: A completed [Conflict of Interest in
Employment](/employment/documents/ConflictOfInterestEmploy.pdf "Conflict of Interest in Employment form") form
constitutes written approval. It must be completed by the unit or
department and approved by either the Provost or the Vice President for
Finance & Operations (whichever is appropriate). The student must
present the approved form to the Student Employment Office BEFORE the
student begins working.
