**Work Study Eligibility** \
General questions regarding Work-Study should be directed to the [Office
of Financial Aid](http://www.finaid.msu.edu/ "Office of Financial Aid").
The information below is specific to Student Employment.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Student Eligibility for Work-Study\
    A student who can demonstrate financial need and has qualified
    through the Office of Financial Aid may be eligible for federal or
    state aid programs. Under the [Work-Study
    Program](http://www.finaid.msu.edu/work.asp "Work Study Program"),
    the student is granted a specific allotment of money to be earned in
    a job while attending the University. The federal government pays
    seventy percent of the student\'s wage. The remaining thirty percent
    is paid by the employing department. It is important to note that
    the program is designed to create additional employment
    opportunities for students. Displacement of either a non Work-Study
    student or full-time employee as a cost reducing tool is viewed as a
    violation of the law governing this program. Also, Work-Study
    students may not work more than 29 hours per week for Work-Study
    reimbursement during the academic year or summer semester. During
    periods between semesters and finals week, they may work up to 40
    hours per week; however, departments will only be reimbursed for the
    first 29 hours worked per week.
-   Work-Study students must maintain the following enrollment minimums
    during the academic year:\
    -   Undergraduates: 6 credits per semester
    -   Masters: 5 credits per semester
    -   PhD: 3 credits per semester
-   Work-Study Earnings Limit\
    The amount the student can earn on the Work-Study Program is limited
    to the amount of the Work-Study award for the academic year or
    summer semester period. The student can continue employment after
    exhausting the Work-Study award amount for the aid period provided
    the employer is willing to pay 100% of the student\'s earnings.
    These additional earnings will not jeopardize the student\'s current
    financial aid award.
-   Due to federal regulations, work-study students can only be hired as
    hourly employees.

**Community Service Work-Study** \
Institutions are required by the [Department of
Education](http://www.ed.gov/index.jhtml "Department of Education") to
use at least seven percent of their total Federal Work-Study allocation
to compensate students who are employed in jobs in which they engage in
community service. Community service jobs include positions that \"are
designed to improve the quality of life for community residents or to
solve particular problems related to their needs\".

Some examples of positions that are considered to be community service
in nature are:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Childcare services that are open to the public
-   Research projects in which the student is assisting with the actual
    research and the research benefits the community
-   Tutors who are tutoring those who are not students at MSU. \
    students who work for a department that provides a service to the
    community and have direct interaction with the clients (e.g.:
    museum, language lab, library, public broadcasting)
-   Other jobs that meet the requirements if they are open to the public
    are health care, literacy training, welfare, social services,
    community improvement, crime prevention and control, transportation,
    recreation, rural development, public safety, youth corps, housing
    and neighborhood improvement, education, counseling (personal or
    career), support services for members of the community with
    disabilities or support for community recreation activities
:::

Students who are in positions where they engage in community service
must have job descriptions on file at the Financial Aid Office.

Students are identified as Work Study when the department indicates Work
Study via the Enterprise Business System (EBS).
