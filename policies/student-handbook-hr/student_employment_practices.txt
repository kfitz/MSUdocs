Interviewing {#interviewing xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
------------

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
Interviews should be non-discriminatory and are for the purpose of
allowing the job applicants to learn about the position and the work
setting, and for the interviewer to find the best fit for the position.
:::

-   Remain within legal guidelines. Under the [Americans with
    Disabilities
    Act](/policies-procedures/student-handbook/Section-Laws-Regulations.html "Americans with Disabilities Act"),
    employers are prohibited from discriminating against an individual
    based on disability status in employment practices such as hiring,
    wages and termination. Also, Michigan State University\'s
    [Anti-Discrimination
    Policy](/policies-procedures/university-wide/index.html "Anti-Discrimination Policy")
    prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, color, gender,
    handicap, height, marital status, national origin, political
    persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, Vietnam-era veteran
    status, or weight. You can find a reproduction of the
    [Pre-Employment Inquiry
    Guide](/policies-procedures/student-handbook/index.html "Pre-Employment Guide from Michigan Department of Civil Rights"),
    published by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights provides
    information on what questions may and may not legally be asked of an
    applicant.
-   During the interview, both parties should come to an an
    understanding of expectations.
-   Departments must inform all applicants of the essential functions of
    the position including. You can refer to the list of [student
    employee
    positions](/ua/hiring/documents/StudentJobDescriptions.pdf "student employee positons PDF").
-   A structured interview insures that all candidates for the position
    are asked the same questions in the same way. Pre-employment testing
    is not permitted. It is best to have a list of questions to ask all
    candidates. Questions can be open-ended (\"Can you give me an
    example of \... ? \"), or \"yes\" or \"no\" answers (\"Can you
    operate a \... ?\"). You need to be specific on necessary
    information concerning driving a car or other skills essential to
    the position. It is risky to assume anything. Some sample questions
    might be:
    -   We need the student employee to be available for 12 hours a
        week. Are you able to be here 12 hours a week, including final
        exam week?
    -   What computer software programs are you proficient in?
    -   Do you have a valid vehicle operator\'s license?
    -   Do you enjoy meeting and greeting people?
    -   Tell me/us what you enjoyed most about your last job. Why?
-   Pre-Employment testing is not permitted

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
-   Hiring Students: All MSU departments must use the Enterprise
    Business System (EBS) Portal to process new hires.
-   Medical Exams: Some positions may require medical/physical
    examinations for employment. Medical exams may not be performed
    until after a job offer has been made and accepted. All information
    resulting from such an exam is confidential and should be maintained
    outside of the student\'s employment file. Any medical information
    currently in a student\'s employment file should be removed. An
    employee\'s written request for accommodation and documentation
    related to the accommodation (other than medical records) may be
    kept in the student\'s medical file.
