Student Employment Manual {#student-employment-manual-1 xmlns=""}
=========================

This Student Employment Manual provides information related to hiring
and working with student employees. If you are not able to find the
answer to your question here, please contact MSU Student Employment.

Definition of a Student Employee {#definition-of-a-student-employee xmlns=""}
--------------------------------

A student employee is a part-time employee who is duly enrolled at
Michigan State University, is registered for classes and whose primary
purpose for being at the University is the achievement of a degree or
certification. During summer semester, an individual may be a student
employee if s/he has been admitted/readmitted and is enrolled for summer
or fall semester classes. Student employees are considered at-will
employees, and their employment is interim or temporary and incidental
to the pursuit of a degree or certification.

This definition excludes students who are employed as academic support
personnel such as Graduate Assistants, Undergraduate Assistants,
Assistant Instructors, and Academic Advisors. Questions concerning the
employment of students in these categories should be directed to the
Office of the Provost, the appropriate Vice President, or Dean.

Students who have graduated and are not planning to continue with
another degree program, may stay on the student employee payroll until
the day before the next semester begins if they are to continue working

Introduction {#introduction xmlns=""}
------------
