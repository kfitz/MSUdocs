**Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide**

 Reprinted from the Official Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide from the
Michigan Department of Civil Rights.

**Introduction**                  \
In accord with Section 206 of Public Act 453 of 1976, which is known as
the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, an employer, labor organization, or
employment agency shall not print, circulate, post, mail, or otherwise
cause to be published a statement, advertisement, notice, or sign
relating to employment by the employer, or relating to a membership in
or classification or referral for employment by the labor organization,
or relating to a classification or referral for employment by the
employment agency, which indicates a preference, limitation,
specification, or discrimination, based on religion, race, color,
national origin, age, sex, height, weight or marital status.

Except as permitted by rules promulgated by the Michigan Civil Rights
Commission or by applicable federal law, an employer or employment
agency shall not:

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
-   Make or use a written or oral inquiry or form of application that
    elicits or attempts to elicit information concerning the religion,
    race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital
    status of a prospective employee.
-   Make or keep a record of information described above in
    subdivision (a) or to disclose that information.
-   Make or use a written or oral inquiry or form of application that
    expresses a preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination
    based on religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height,
    weight or marital status of a prospective employee.

Section 206 of Public Act 220 of 1976, which is known as the Michigan
Handicappers\' Civil Rights Act, provides for similar protection for the
handicapped if the specific handicap is unrelated to the individual\'s
ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position. The
[Michigan Department of Civil
Rights](http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr "Michigan Department of Civil Rights")
has developed a Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide to assist employers and
employment agencies in complying with both Acts 220 and 453 in regard to
pre-employment inquiries and securing certain data relating to job
applicants. The Guide constitutes an interpretation of the Acts in this
regard and is intended to aid in preventing practices that have a high
potential for unlawful discrimination. Nothing in the guidelines or Acts
prevents employers from hiring competent and reliable workers. The
purpose of the Act is not to interfere with an employer\'s right to hire
qualified persons but to prevent those characteristics, which are not
job-related, such as race, sex, marital status, etc., from influencing
the selection process.

One of the most effective ways to ensure sound selection procedures and
to avoid unlawful discrimination is for employers to carefully develop
written, job-related position descriptions which outline the required
skills and abilities for each position. Obviously, the purpose of a
sound selection process is to obtain good employees who can meet
specific work requirements and successfully perform the particular job
duties. A person\'s race, sex, marital status, handicap, et cetera are
not indicators of an individual\'s potential to be a good worker.
Keeping in mind the specific job requirements and only the pertinent
skills required to perform the particular job, employers may elicit
adequate information on their employment applications that will aid in
making a good selection. Employers can deprive themselves of valuable
employees by stereotyping rather than judging applicants on an
individual basis. In screening employment applicants, assumptions should
not be made based on an applicant\'s identity or status. For example, it
should not be assumed that because a woman has small children she would
not be able to work odd hours. The issue is whether she can, in fact,
work odd hours and not whether she has children. Therefore, the
applicant should be asked directly whether she can work odd hours and
not if she has children. It is essential that employers carefully
examine the job-relatedness of all questions and develop different
employment applications from different job groups. For example, more
detailed information is needed about an applicant for a highly technical
computer position than a person seeking a job as a laborer. The
following question areas normally constitute the core of the
application:

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
-   Identification of the applicant (name, address and telephone).
-   Applicant\'s interests (which jobs, salary levels).
-   Summary of the applicant\'s background (education and training, work
    history, special qualifications and skills).
:::

This is essential information and questions designed to elicit such
information are basic to an employment application form. Beyond this
basic information, employers must design questions to elicit job-related
information which will be applicable and useful in meeting their needs.
Obviously, questions which elicit information that may have an adverse
impact on classes protected by civil rights legislation should be
avoided.

The Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide includes certain informational items
that are considered unlawful pre-employment inquires, but may be needed
for payroll and fringe benefit purposes (marital status, number of
dependents, et cetera). This information should not be requested on the
employment application but can be lawfully secured subsequent to hiring.
It should have no bearing in the selection process.

In accord with Section 206 of both Acts 220 and 453 and Michigan Civil
Rights Commission Rules, employers may be granted approval by the
Commission to collect data needed to carry out approved affirmative
action plans. This constitutes the granting of exceptions to collecting
data prohibited by Acts 220 and 453. Employers may apply to the Michigan
Civil Rights Commission, 1200 Sixth Street, Detroit 48226, and include a
copy of the affirmative action plan. Employees may also apply to the
Commission for exemptions on the basis that religion, national origin,
age, height, weight or sex is a bona fide occupational qualification.
However, there must be sufficient showing that an exemption is essential
to the normal operation of the business based on business necessity.

The Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide can be used as an effective tool in
minimizing the number of employment discrimination complaints, which
benefits employers because of the financial savings of not having to
defend such complaints. Employers who wish to have their employment
applications reviewed may do so by forwarding a request and a copy of
the application form to the Director of Enforcement, Michigan Department
of Civil Rights, 1200 Sixth Street, Detroit 48226.

NOTE:

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
-   The Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide is based on the provisions of
    Public Acts 220 and 453 of 1976\*. Employers who are subject to
    Public Act 453 may apply to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission for
    an exemption on the basis that religion, national origin, age,
    height, weight, or sex is a bona fide occupational qualification
    essential to the normal operation of the business or enterprise.
    Upon sufficient showing by the employer, the Commission may grant an
    exception. An employer may have a bona fide occupational
    qualification on the basis of religion, national origin, sex, or
    marital status, height and weight without obtaining prior exemption
    from the Commission, provided that an employer who does not obtain
    an exemption shall have the burden of establishing that the
    qualification is reasonably necessary or essential to the normal
    operation of the business. In the absence of business necessity, a
    selection criterion should not be used if it has a
    disproportionately burdensome effect, or disparate impact, upon
    those of a particular race, color, national origin, sex, age,
    marital status, religion, height, weight, or the handicapped.
-   Exceptions to the list of unlawful questions are permitted by
    applicable federal law or by rules promulgated by the Michigan Civil
    Rights Commission, including rules relating to affirmative action
    plans if approved by the Commission. Upon application to the
    Commission, employers may be permitted to make pre-employment
    inquires prohibited by the Public Acts 220 and 453 for purposes not
    inconsistent with the Constitution and Statutes.
-   It is unlawful to make or use a written or oral inquiry or form of
    application that elicits information concerning the handicap of a
    prospective employee for reasons contrary to the provisions or
    purposes of Act 220.
