**Rest Periods**

::: {xmlns=""}
-   It is University policy that student employees should be given a 15
    minute rest period during each continuous four hours of work. Rest
    periods are scheduled by the supervisor to insure the continued
    efficiency of the work unit.
-   The rest period is to be preceded and followed by a work period. It
    should not be used to cover a student\'s late arrival or early
    departure. Rest periods cannot be accumulated.
