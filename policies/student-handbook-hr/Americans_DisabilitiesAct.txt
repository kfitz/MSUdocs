**Americans with Disabilities Act**

[Official Americans with Disabilities Act
site](http://www.ada.gov/ "ADA Home page")                  \
[United States Department of Education Office for Civil
Rights](http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html "US Office for Civil Rights")               

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act (504), and the [Michigan Persons with Disabilities
Civil Rights Act
(MPDCRA)](http://www.michigan.gov/documents/PWDCRA10-05_115444_7.pdf "Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (MPDCRA)"),
qualified applicants and employees with disabilities are protected from
discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, job training,
benefits and other aspects of employment. These laws provide that
qualified individuals with a disability must be provided with reasonable
accommodations that do not impose undue hardship.

The MPDCRA requires an employee to request accommodations within 182
days from the date the employee discovered or should have discovered the
need for accommodation. Failure to notify the employer of this need
within 182 days releases the employer from its obligation to accommodate
under the MPDCRA. The employer is not released from its obligation to
accommodate under the ADA and Section 504; however, complaints alleging
discrimination prohibited by the ADA and 504 must be filed within time
limits set forth in the statutes and implementing regulations.

Questions should be directed to [MSU Student
Employment](/policies-procedures/student-handbook/index.html "Contact Student Employment ")
or the [Resource Center for Persons With Disabilities
(RCPD)](http://www.rcpd.msu.edu/ "RCPD Website").
