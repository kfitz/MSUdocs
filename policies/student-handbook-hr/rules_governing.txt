**Rules Governing Personal Conduct of Student Employees**

::: {xmlns=""}
Rules of personal conduct for employees are intended to promote the
orderly and efficient operation of the university, as well as to protect
the rights of all employees. Violations, therefore, shall be regarded as
cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Termination may result from an accumulation of minor infractions as well
as for a single serious infraction. This statement of Rules Governing
Personal Conduct of Employees does not preclude the establishment of
additional rules for its employees by any University department that are
necessary for the effective operation of that department.
:::

Disciplinary action under these rules does not free an employee from
possible criminal liabilities, nor preclude sanctions established for
violations of [MSU
Ordinances](http://trustees.msu.edu/ordinances/ "MSU Ordinances") or
state or federal laws.
