**Student Employee Supervisor Responsibilities** {#student-employee-supervisor-responsibilities .page-title xmlns=""}
------------------------------------------------

General Conditions of Employment for Students {#general-conditions-of-employment-for-students xmlns=""}
---------------------------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
All student employees at Michigan State University are subject to the
rules governing personal conduct of employees. These conditions apply to
each student employee regardless of the department in which the student
is employed.
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
 
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
At the date of hire, it is the responsibility of the hiring department
to insure that the student understands all of the conditions of
employment. These conditions should include the duties of the student\'s
job, starting and ending dates of employment (if indicated), starting
pay rate, rights, responsibilities and any departmental personnel
policies. It is best if this information is in writing.
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
 
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
Basic conditions affecting all student employees at Michigan State
University are as follows:
:::

-   Student employees MUST be processed for employment through the EBS
    Portal prior to starting work.
-   Satisfactory performance is expected of student workers while
    employed with the university. If a department feels that a student
    is not fulfilling the duties of their job as explained at the date
    of hire, the situation should be discussed the the student as soon
    as it is recognized to insure that the student fully understands the
    work responsibilities before any further time lapses.
-   Campus-wide student employment policies and procedures pertaining to
    wages, hours worked, hiring procedures and utilization of student
    labor at Michigan State University will be established by MSU
    Student Employment.
-   Student employees cannot work on a volunteer basis at a job for
    which they are normally paid.

Training Student Employees {#training-student-employees xmlns=""}
--------------------------

Supervisors train, motivate, communicate, guide and evaluate their
student employees. You serve as models for the development of good work
habits such as punctuality, dependability, cooperation, honesty, and
efficiency. In the academic setting, it is often difficult to provide
sufficient time or flexibility of schedules to provide an adequate
period for training student employees. Supervisors must continue to meet
service and production demands; students quickly become immersed in
their academic and extracurricular pursuits. Good personnel practices
require that every new worker be oriented to the hiring unit and trained
in skills necessary for satisfactory performance.

Orientation {#orientation xmlns=""}
-----------

Students are more likely to become enthusiastic and take pride in their
work when they understand the role of their department in the total
institutional picture. At orientation sessions, the activities of the
department are explained, students are informed of the \"do\'s\" and
\"don\'ts\" of the job - if their work involves meeting the public, what
is the proper attire, what is the proper behavior. This is also an
opportune time to explain what procedures are to be followed when
illness or other reasons keep a student away from daily work
assignments.

Demonstrations of Skills and Procedures {#demonstrations-of-skills-and-procedures xmlns=""}
---------------------------------------

Most training occurs on-the-job with the supervisor demonstrating and
describing the correct methods and skills to be utilized. In doing so,
we should avoid these common training errors:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Giving too much information at one time;
-   Giving instructions too rapidly;
-   Failure to determine the student\'s level of experience;
-   Not permitting enough opportunity for questions

There are unique circumstances related to each student\'s job that
cannot be outlined in a general policy manual. Therefore, it is the
supervisor\'s role to determine the job duties and responsibilities
assigned to that job within the definition of the [job
classification](https://www.hr.msu.edu/hiring/studentemployment/StudentJobDescriptions.pdf "Student Employee Job Classifications PDF").
:::

Supplemental Material {#supplemental-material xmlns=""}
---------------------

While some supervisors are excellent articulators, there is often the
danger of overwhelming the student with more information than the
student needs or can retain. A department brochure, fact sheet, or
annual report can be given to the student to read, keep and refer to. In
addition, handbooks and other volumes which explain skills, procedures
and processes necessary to the student\'s job performance should be
available whenever possible.

Student-Supervisor Relationships {#student-supervisor-relationships xmlns=""}
--------------------------------

The college years are both exciting and trying times for a young person
attempting many new things. This excitement and the individual concerns
of students are brought daily into the work situation and form the basis
of various interpersonal relationships between students and supervisors.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Develop rapport
-   Maintain impartiality
-   Be a co-learner
-   Show respect
-   Be flexible
:::

Finally, you must always view each student employee as a total person,
not simply as a worker assigned to a task for several hours daily. It is
your responsibility to help the student put concerns in proper
perspective so that they do not overshadow activities in the workplace.

Evaluation {#evaluation xmlns=""}
----------

Evaluation is an on-going process that occurs almost daily. After the
student is given initial training, make periodic checks to see that
performance is meeting the desired expectations.

The long-range goal of student evaluation is not simply to provide a
system for grading work. It is designed as an instrument to assist in
the student\'s development and to enlarge the dimensions of the work
experience.

Each unit should determine the frequency and type of evaluation
procedure they wish to use. Listed here are general categories that can
be used to create an evaluation form for your specific unit.

Quality and Quantity of Work {#quality-and-quantity-of-work xmlns=""}
----------------------------

Criteria for evaluating work product, productivity, and the quality of
work performed:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Is responsive to deadlines and notifies affected parties when
    meeting deadlines is not possible.
-   Plans and observes work time responsibly.
-   Works effectively and efficiently with all co-workers.
-   Accurate and thorough in all work assignments.
-   Completes work with little or no supervision.
-   Completes work following specific instructions, policies and
    procedures.
-   Demonstrates high quality standards in all interactions and work
    assignments.
-   Exercises good judgment and makes appropriate decisions in
    performance of duties.
:::

Work Characteristics and Attributes {#work-characteristics-and-attributes xmlns=""}
-----------------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Presents and promotes a positive image of the institution through
    business-like conduct, attitude, and appearance.
-   Customer service-focused, exhibiting helpful, friendly, and
    courteous service.
-   Demonstrates punctual, reliable and consistent attendance.
-   Demonstrates the ability to appreciate and work with a diverse
    population.
-   Proactively and willingly acquires new skills, tasks, procedures,
    and projects.
-   Self-starter; takes action without being asked.
-   Willing to accept suggestions and training; takes direction.
-   Flexible.
-   Asks questions when needed
:::

Job Knowledge and Skills {#job-knowledge-and-skills xmlns=""}
------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Respects confidentiality of all student and MSU documents,
    information, records, etc.
-   Demonstrates knowledge of the position, department, division, and
    institution mission and goals.
-   Ability to accurately follow oral and written instructions,
    directions, policies and procedures of the department.
-   Demonstrates the ability to make sound judgments.
-   Deals with difficult situations effectively.
-   Demonstrates effective and appropriate written and oral
    communication skills.

Work Concerns
-------------

Working with people in any job setting frequently presents certain
personnel problems. Student workers are often more responsive to
counseling and they accept work evaluations as they accept academic
measurement.

Often, the beginnings of student problems go unnoticed until the matter
becomes large, affecting either production or department morale. Where
counseling by the supervisor has been tried with poor results, MSU
Student Employment should be contacted and assistance requested.
:::

Unsatisfactory Performance {#unsatisfactory-performance xmlns=""}
--------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
Student employees who demonstrate either unsatisfactory work performance
or unsatisfactory work attendance may be warned and given time to
correct the problem, or be dismissed.
:::

These actions should be documented:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   **Warning:** Upon demonstration of unsatisfactory performance or
    attendance, the student should be told in private explicitly how job
    requirements are not being met, and allowed a reasonable period to
    improve their performance with the understanding that unless work
    performance or attendance is improved, their employment will be
    terminated. The supervisor should take steps toward improved
    communication or instruction enabling the student employee to
    achieve satisfactory performance.
-   **Written Warning:** If the student\'s work performance continues to
    fall below required standards, the student should be informed in
    writing of the unsatisfactory performance.
-   **Termination:** If, after at least one written warning, the
    student\'s performance has not improved, the student\'s
    employment may be terminated.
