**Placing a Student on Payroll**

::: {xmlns=""}
**Hiring Process** \
All students MUST be processed through the EBS Portal prior to starting
work. This procedure ensures that departments hire students who are
eligible to work on campus and/or provides employers with information
concerning Work-Study.
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
-   The employing department must submit student hiring forms using
    the Enterprise Business System (EBS) Portal. 
-   Departments should refer to the [Job Description
    Document](/ua/hiring/documents/StudentJobDescriptions.pdf "Job Description Document PDF") to
    determine the correct grade level and job classification. Pay rates
    are reviewed and approved annually by the MSU Board of Trustees in
    mid-July.
-   An Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Form must be completed
    and on file via the electronic I-9 system.
-   Upon approval of the hiring information in the EBS Portal, the
    student should complete a Federal (W4) Withholding Allowance
    Certificate and a Michigan (MI-W4) Withholding Allowance
    Certificate. The forms for U.S. citizens and permanent residents
    must be completed by using the EBS Portal. International students
    should go directly to the [Payroll
    Office](http://ctlr.msu.edu/Download.aspx "Payroll"), 350
    Administration Building, to fill out their forms.
-   Forms to authorize direct deposit of student payroll checks should
    also be completed in the EBS Portal. 
:::

**Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) Processing**

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Federal regulations require that an [Employment Eligibility
    Verification (I-9) ](/ua/i9/index.html "I9 Information")form be
    completed within three days of the start of work.  If the student
    has previously been on MSU payroll, a new I-9 form will not be
    required as long as there has not been more than a year of break in
    service. 
:::

**Other Forms**

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Exposure to Health Risks: If there is exposure to health risks on
    the job, as identified by the employing department, the employing
    department must attach a copy of the [Exposure to Health Risks
    Form](https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/hiring/documents/HealthRiskPhysDemands.pdf "Health Risks/Physical Demands Form") to
    the EBS Portal hiring form, and a Health Assessment of the student
    employee must be done at [MSU Occupational
    Health](http://occhealth.msu.edu/contact "Occupational Health").\
    \
    Questions about job exposure risks should be directed to
    the [Environmental Health &
    Safety](http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/ "Environmental Health & Safety").

-   [Michigan Right-to-Know
    Law](/policies-procedures/university-wide/index.html "Michigan Right to Know Act"):
    The Michigan Right-to-Know Law requires that all employees who may
    be exposed to hazardous chemicals receive chemical safety awareness
    training. \
    -   Student employees who are known to be or who could potentially
        be exposed to hazardous chemicals must be informed of their
        rights under the law and specific safety procedures necessary to
        work with these materials.
    -   Student employees who are not working with hazardous chemicals
        or who have a low probability of exposure must also be informed
        that they may request the same training concerning their rights
        under the law.
    -   Training may be accomplished in the same manner used for other
        employees: written communications, video presentations, and
        in-house training.
    -   Contact the [Environmental Health &
        Safety](http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/ "Environmental Health & Safety") for
        additional information and assistance regarding video
        presentations and training.
-   [MSU Drug-Free Workplace
    Policy](/policies-procedures/student-handbook/index.html "MSU Drug-Free Workplace Policy"):
    The employing department should inform student employees of the MSU
    Drug-Free workplace policy.
-   Additional Requirements: The employing department should inform
    student employees of departmental and Student Employment policies
    and procedures, and the need to notify the employer of accommodation
    needs if the student wishes to declare a disability.
:::

**[]{#Controls}Department Controls**

::: {xmlns=""}
-   In order to ensure adequate internal control, departments employing
    students should have at least two separate individuals involved in
    the process. One person should process hiring and enter time in
    CATS. A second person should approve their time in CATS. 
-   Original student time records are to be signed by the student and
    the appropriate supervisor attesting to the number of hours worked.
    The student\'s signature is not required for departments that
    maintain time worked records via a time clock system.
-   In the event that a time record is used in an electronic manner, the
    use of the msu.edu email address will be required as the signature
    authority for the transaction.
-   The records are to be maintained at least three years at the
    departmental level.
-   Student time sheets are due on a bi-weekly basis and must be turned
    in EVERY pay period. Students must be paid for ALL hours worked
    and time cannot be \"banked\" or \"saved\" to be paid out at a later
    date.
