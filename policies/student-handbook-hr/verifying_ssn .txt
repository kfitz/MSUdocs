**Verifying SSN for Student Employees**

::: {xmlns=""}
MSU must verify that student employee earnings turned into
the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/ "Internal Revenue Service Main Page") are
recorded under the correct social security number and name.  In an
effort to save staff and student time in processing student employees
for payroll, the following procedures are now in effect:
:::

**New Student Employees**

::: {xmlns="" style="text-align: left;"}
If the new student employee has a social security card, the employee
should be asked to present the social security card. The employee may
show the card if it is available. Hiring departments may, but are not
required to, photocopy the social security card if the employee provides
it. The hiring department must verify in the EBS Portal that the
student\'s social security number and name are correct/same as on social
security card.

You will enter the number in the EBS Portal and indicate on the
form that its been verified.

If the new student employee has a social security number but does not
have the social security card:

-   The student is given 3 weeks to obtain a duplicate card and may be
    able to [apply
    online.](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ "Social Security Administration Website Apply") Those
    who cannot apply online must apply in person at the [Social Security
    Administration
    Office](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/ic001.do#officeResults "Social Security Office Information") located
    at:

                                                                    
5210 Perry Robinson Court, Lansing, MI 48911

-   The student must bring their duplicate social security card to the
    hiring department when its been received, and then fax a copy of the
    card to Student Employment at  2-3862. If the student does not bring
    their card within 3 weeks, the student\'s position(s) will be
    terminated. 
:::

**International students without Social Security Number - First time
Hire at the University** \
The situation with international students continues to change as the
federal government revises the rules governing international students.
The Student Employment Office will notify departments when rules change.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Complete and print the \"Social Security Letter for F-1 or J-1
    Students\" form on the [OISS
    website](http://www.oiss.msu.edu/ "Office for International Students & Scholars").
    (Follow the \"click here to review\" link).
-   The student takes the signed \"Social Security Letter for F-1 or J-1
    Students\" form to OISS and an OISS staff member will sign the form
    verifying that the student has met enrollment requirements and
    completed the proper paperwork for employment. (May include
    completing the I9.)
-   The student goes to the Social Security Administration with all
    required paperwork and applies for a Social Security number.
    International students can apply for a social security number at the
    Social Security Administration Office after being in the U.S. for 15
    days. They cannot apply online.
-   The hiring departments completes the hire in the EBS Portal.  
-   Once the student has received their social security card, please fax
    a copy to Student Employment, 2-3862.

 

NOTE: Departments may not require a student to present their Social
Security card for the purposes of filling out the I-9 UNLESS
the student employee is choosing the Social Security Card as one of the
verifying documents in Section 2.\
