SELLING AND SOLICITATION CENTRAL GUIDELINES


In accordance with Michigan State University ordinance 27.01, the
Secretary of the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University
promulgates these general standards concerning the grant of permits to
sell or solicit sales or contributions on University premises:

1. SCOPE.
Ordinance 27.01 and these standards do not apply (a) to University
departments or divisions whose operations include sales or
solicitations, (b) with respect to charitable solicitations in which the
University participates as an institution or de minimis sales for
charity by University employees or students who derive no personal
financial gain from the sales, or (c) in connection with sales to the
University.

2. LIMITATIONS.

(a) Permits will be granted only to (i) registered student
organizations, living unit organizations, and major student governing
groups, (ii) non-student University affiliated organizations, (iii)
academic and administrative university units, (iv) groups selling or
soliciting in conjunction with authorized activities at University
facilities, and (v) vendors or suppliers with which the University has a
contractual relationship, provided that a vendor or supplier which has
entered into a formal contractual relationship with the University
concerning sales or solicitation activities shall not be required to
have a permit separate from an executed contract or purchase order,
except for sales activities not described in the contract or purchase
order.

(b) Permits will be granted only for sales or solicitation activities
which (i) do not violate or conflict with University ordinances,
guidelines, or regulations or other applicable laws or regulations, (ii)
do not infringe upon the University’s trademark or other intellectual
property rights, (iii) do not result in a breach of University contracts
or compete with University or University-contracted operations, (iv) do
not jeopardize public or individual safety, (v) will be conducted by
members of the organization holding the permit, and (vi) are covered by
such insurance as may be deemed necessary by the University’s Department
of Risk Management and Insurance.

(c) Permits will not be granted for the sale of alcoholic beverages,
tobacco products, or firearms.

3. GRANT OF PERMITS.

(a) Permits will be granted by the offices responsible for the proposed
sale or solicitation location (list under development). Each such
responsible office (i) may prohibit sales entirely in all or a portion
of its facility(s) or location(s) or in conjunction with a specified
program or function or (ii) may establish additional standards specific
to its facility(s) or area(s), which address time, place and manner
restrictions and are approved by the Secretary of the Board of Trustees.
To the extent that time and place restrictions result in a limited
number of permits being available, permits shall be granted in the order
applications are received by the appropriate office.

(b) Grant of a sales or solicitation permit shall imply neither approval
nor disapproval of the purposes of the group, the activities conducted,
the content of any materials distributed or any items being sold.
