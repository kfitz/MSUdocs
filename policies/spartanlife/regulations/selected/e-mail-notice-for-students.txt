EMAIL NOTICE FOR STUDENTS


MSU STUDENT EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS NOTICE

Michigan State University (MSU) uses email as one of several means of
communication with students. In the context of this notice, “student”
refers to all persons who have been admitted to MSU as a student,
whether or not they have registered or enrolled for classes. An official
MSU email address is issued to each student at the time he or she is
admitted to MSU. This official MSU email address takes the form of a
person’s MSU NetID followed by “@msu.edu” (e.g., sparty@msu.edu) and
resides in MSU email system. This is the only email address that the
University will centrally maintain for sending official communications
to students, and the only email address that the University will use for
sending official communications to students after they enroll.

Students are responsible for activating their MSU NetID and email
account; both of these may be accomplished on the NetID website at
_netid.msu.edu_. Students must check email regularly in order to read
important messages and notifications. Certain communications may be
time-sensitive. Failure to read official University communications sent
to the students’ official MSU email addresses does not absolve students
from knowing and complying with the content of those communications.

Each student must manage his or her University email account to ensure
that the Inbox file has sufficient space to allow for email delivery.
Students act at their own risk and should take precautions if they
choose to have their email forwarded to an email address other than
their official MSU email address. Commercial and other email services
sometimes block email from external sources. “Spam” filters applied
outside of the MSU email service may block email that the student needs
to receive. MSU is not responsible for any difficulties that may occur
in the proper or timely transmission of or access to email forwarded to
any email address other than the official MSU email address, or which
may be blocked by spam filters other than those applied by the MSU email
system itself. Any such difficulties will not absolve students of their
responsibility to know and comply with the content of official
communications sent to students’ official MSU email addresses.

Use of email for official communications with students will comply with
other applicable MSU policies and business practices.
