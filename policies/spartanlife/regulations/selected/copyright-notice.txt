COPYRIGHT NOTICE


NOTICE OF WRITTEN PLAN FOR COPYRIGHT PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION
OPPORTUNITY ACT August 26, 2010

BASIS

Michigan State University’s _Procedures for Addressing Instances of
Possible Copyright Infringement on Michigan State University’s (MSU)
Computing Resources and Network_ forbid the unlawful copying or
distribution of copyrighted works in any form.

This document is the “written plan” required of the University under the
copyright-related regulations associated with the Higher Education
Opportunity Act of 2008.

A. ANNUAL DISCLOSURE

Each year, close to the beginning of Fall Semester, a notice is sent by
email to every individual having a MSU network ID to inform them that
illegal distribution of copyrighted material is prohibited and may
subject them to criminal or civil liability. The notice provides a link
to MSU’s Procedures for Addressing Instances of Possible Copyright
Infringement on Michigan State University’s (MSU) Computing Resources
and Network (MSU’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) procedures).

B. COMBATING UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL

The University addresses unauthorized distribution of copyrighted
material through a variety of educational, technical, and disciplinary
means. These include:

• Informs all network users and (more frequently) students of their
obligations to follow copyright laws, of MSU policies and practices
regarding copyright infringement; enhanced communications now a part of
our SecureIT safe computing campaign;
• Presentations, posters, press articles, hand-outs, and other
informational and educational mechanisms explaining the difference
between appropriate and inappropriate use of copyrighted materials;
• Library, online, and other resources to assist students, faculty and
staff with copyright questions and copyright clearances;
• Full cooperation with copyright owners or their agents to investigate
and take appropriate actions on their complaints of alleged infringement
of their copyrights;
• DMCA policy and a vigorous program for accepting and promptly
responding to DMCA notices;
• Standardized and consistent handling of procedural and disciplinary
response to alleged violations of the University’s copyright policies.
Student network access may be suspended on a first complaint and is
suspended for second complaints; second complaint also involves
mandatory in-person meeting of student with an administrator; third
complaint results in automatic referral to student judiciary system and
may result in suspension from school; second and third level student
complaints involve a mandatory fee which escalates with subsequent
complaints; employees referred into appropriate employee disciplinary
process;
• Blocks unsolicited inbound Internet connections to all DHCP network
addresses (i.e., to computers not officially set up as servers);
• Asymmetric bandwidth availability at residence hall ports slows
uploading (10 Mbps inbound; 768 Kbps outbound)

C. ALTERNATIVES TO ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING

The market for legal downloads is constantly changing. EDUCAUSE provides
a well-updated online list of legal sources of downloads and accessing
media.

D. PERIODIC REVIEW

This document and the associated practices and processes will be
reviewed at least annually (reviews may be triggered more frequently
when circumstances change in ways that suggest a review should be
undertaken) by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in consultation with
the offices of the Provost, Human Resources, Student Affairs and
Services, and General Counsel.

-   Revised June 2017 to update the DMCA process since first level DMCA
    complaints no longer incur a fee.
