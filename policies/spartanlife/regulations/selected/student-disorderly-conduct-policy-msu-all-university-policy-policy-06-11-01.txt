STUDENT DISORDERLY CONDUCT POLICY, MSU


(All-University Policy) (Policy # 06-11-01)

PROHIBITION
Michigan State University students shall not engage in disorderly
conduct at or in connection with a riot.

DEFINITIONS
“Riot” means five or more persons, acting in concert, who engage in
violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly cause or create
a serious risk of causing public terror or alarm.

“Acting in concert” means acting with a common intent or purpose.

“Disorderly conduct at or in connection with a riot” includes, but is
not limited to, setting fires; throwing bottles or other projectiles;
damaging, destroying, or defacing property not the student’s own;
obstructing, interfering with, or disrupting the activities of peace
officers or public safety personnel engaged in the lawful performance of
their official duties; intentionally or recklessly causing or
threatening physical harm to another; endangering the physical safety of
another; tampering with or misusing fire or safety equipment; theft or
looting; resisting arrest; and conspiring with others or inciting others
to do any of the foregoing.

APPLICATION
This Policy applies to all Michigan State University students whenever
the prohibited conduct occurs on the land governed by the Board of
Trustees of Michigan State University (the “campus”), when students are
engaged in University-sponsored or student group sponsored (student
governing group and registered student organization) activities off
campus, in all local government jurisdictions adjacent to the campus, or
on any other college or university campus.

ENFORCEMENT
Violations of this Policy will be adjudicated according to procedures
outlined in Article 4 of _Michigan State University Student Rights and
Responsibilities_.

Students found through University disciplinary proceedings to have
violated this Policy may be subjected to a variety of sanctions as
described in Article 5, Section I.H of _Michigan State University
Student Rights and Responsibilities_. These sanctions may include: No
Action, Warning, Probation, Suspension or Dismissal from the University.
Either probation may also include stipulations requiring a student
living on-campus to move to another location on- or off-campus. Students
may also be required to make restitution for damage to University
property.

In addition to sanctions outlined in Article 5 of _Michigan State
University Student Rights and Responsibilities_, violators of this
Policy may also be required to make restitution for damage to public and
private property.

In some instances, students accused of violating this Policy may be
suspended on an interim basis.¹

Behaviors violating this Policy may also be in violation of professional
standards established by colleges and professional schools at Michigan
State University. Procedures for adjudicating these alleged violations
are outlined in the _Graduate Student Rights and_ _Responsibilities_
document, the _Law Student Rights and Responsibilities_ document, and
the _Medical Student Rights and Responsibilities_ document.

INTERPRETATION
This Policy shall not be interpreted to restrict or limit any student’s
First Amendment rights to freedom of speech or assembly.

NOTE: All members of the University community must abide by standards of
behavior that reflect the collegial nature of their endeavors. Faculty
members and staff members are subject to the disciplinary policies set
forth in the _Faculty Handbook_ and the _Employee Handbook_,
respectively.

¹ See Article 5, Section I.I of _Michigan State University Student
Rights and Responsibilities_ which reads: If the Vice President is
presented with credible information that a student’s continued presence
at Michigan State University poses a clear and present danger to the
health or safety of persons or property, the Vice President or his/her
designee may temporarily suspend a student from the University. Before
temporarily suspending a student, the Vice President will make a
reasonable attempt to notify the student of the potential interim
suspension and offer the student an opportunity to present information
that he/she does not pose a threat to persons or property. The interim
suspension shall not preclude, render irrelevant, or predetermine the
outcome of subsequent disciplinary action relating to conduct on which
the interim suspension is based. Nor shall an interim suspension create
a presumption of guilt. Students placed on interim suspension may
petition for reinstatement at any time with the guidelines listed.
