HEARING PROCEDURES


1. Students may register complaints regarding an instructor’s failure to
comply with the provisions of the _Code of Teaching Responsibility_
directly with that instructor.

2. Students may also take complaints directly to teaching units’ chief
administrators or their designates. If those persons are unable to
resolve matters to the student’s satisfaction, undergraduate students
may request a formal grievance hearing before the University Academic
Grievance Hearing Board (see SRR Article 7.III). Unsatisfied graduate
students may request a formal grievance hearing before their department
hearing board (see GSRR Article 5). Before doing this, all students are
encouraged to meet with the University Ombudsperson.

3. Such complaints must normally be initiated no later than the middle
of the semester following the one wherein alleged violations occurred.
Exceptions shall be made in cases where the involved instructor or
student is absent from the University during the semester following the
one wherein alleged violations occurred.
