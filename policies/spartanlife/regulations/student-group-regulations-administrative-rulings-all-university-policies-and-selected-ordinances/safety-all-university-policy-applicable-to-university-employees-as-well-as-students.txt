SAFETY


(All-University Policy) (Applicable to University employees as well as
students.)

It is the policy of Michigan State University to prevent accidents in
work, class, and other activities which the University supervises, is
responsible for, or sponsors. Each person, regardless of official or
unofficial status, who assumes or is assigned responsibility for the
work or activities of others is administratively responsible for their
safety during such work or activities. Investigation of accidents to
University personnel and students during work, class, or sponsored
activities is the responsibility of the person whose job it is to
supervise the person injured.

Each student organization is responsible for safe conditions and safe
practices within its area of activity and for the prevention of
accidents to members and guests. Questions regarding safety standards,
codes, and regulations including those standards pertaining to
decorations, food sanitation, public assemblage, emergency planning,
fire safety, and accident prevention may be directed to the Division of
Safety and Public Health of the MSU Police.

It is the intention of the University that there shall be compliance
with safe practice standards which are a matter of professional
knowledge and with official codes and regulations. Each department is
responsible for the establishment and preservation of safe conditions
and safe practices within the area of jurisdiction of the department.
