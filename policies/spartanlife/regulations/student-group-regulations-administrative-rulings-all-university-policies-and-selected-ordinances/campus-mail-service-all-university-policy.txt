Examples of business communications that can be handled by Campus Mail

professional societies, communications from one department of the
University to another, and memorandums from one individual to another
when pertaining to university business.

Examples of communications that cannot be distributed by Campus Mail
are: Non-university business, letters exchanged between non-university
agencies, letters exchanged between students, requests for contributions
(except Community Charitable Campaign), sales or collections by campus
organizations or individuals, religious announcements, club
announcements, and notices of political or organizational meetings,
anonymous mailings, mailings for commercial, personal or private gain or
those containing commercial advertising for organizations or individuals
not affiliated with the university.
