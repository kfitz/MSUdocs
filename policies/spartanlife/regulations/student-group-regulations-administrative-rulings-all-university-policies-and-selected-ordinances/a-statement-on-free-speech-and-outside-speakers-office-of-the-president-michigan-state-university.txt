FREE SPEECH RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: PRESIDENT’S STATEMENT


Fundamental to MSU’s philosophy on campus dissent is a belief that the
rights guaranteed in the First and Fourteenth amendments of the
Constitution must be protected. The university has worked for decades to
establish a community consensus on the scope of intellectually
productive and constitutionally protected dissent, and to distinguish it
from impermissible disruption.

Michigan State University is a community of scholars whose members
include its faculty, staff, students, and administrators. The basic
purposes of the University are the advancement, dissemination, and
application of knowledge. The most basic condition for the achievement
of these purposes is freedom of expression and communication. Without
this freedom, effective sifting and testing of ideas cease, and
research, teaching, and learning are stifled.

The robust exchange of ideas and perspectives can be indicative of a
healthy intellectual environment. However, actions which directly or
indirectly inhibit the freedoms and rights enjoyed by others are
anathema to maintenance of a collegial environment.

— President Lou Anna K. Simon
