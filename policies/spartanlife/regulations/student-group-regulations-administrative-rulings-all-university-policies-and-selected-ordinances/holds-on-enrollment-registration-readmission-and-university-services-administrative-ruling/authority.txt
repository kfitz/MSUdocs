AUTHORITY FOR HOLD USE


1. FINANCIAL HOLDS
The Vice President for Finance and Treasurer is responsible for the
collection, custody and accounting for all monies due the University.
Holds may be employed to collect any financial obligations due to the
University’s operating funds or to student loan funds.

2. JUDICIAL HOLDS
The procedures for student discipline are specified in _Michigan State
University Student Rights and Responsibilities_, _Graduate Student
Rights and Responsibilities_, _Law Student Rights and Responsibilities_,
and _Medical Student Rights and Responsibilities_. Administrative
officers and judicial bodies are specifically authorized under this
administrative ruling to request of the Provost or the Vice President
for Student Affairs and Services the use of the judicial hold to enforce
a “suspension” decision against a student, and to contact a student to
notify him or her of an alleged violation of a regulation and pending
judicial or administrative proceedings.

3. ACADEMIC HOLDS
Academic holds are used to assure that students abide by reasonable
rules and regulations as a condition of admission to and retention in
the University. Agencies of the University and academic administrators
are authorized under this administrative ruling to initiate use of the
academic hold for this purpose.

4. ADMINISTRATIVE HOLDS
Administrative holds are also used to assure that students abide by
reasonable rules and regulations as a condition of admission to and
retention in the University. Agencies of the University and academic
administrators are authorized under this administrative ruling to
initiate use of the administrative hold for this purpose.
