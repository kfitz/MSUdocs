ADDRESS CHANGE


(Administrative Ruling)

The Housing Requirements and Procedures state the following: “Every
student is required to report his or her correct current address at the
time of registration and to report any change of address thereafter.
Failure to register the actual address at which he or she is living, or
failure to notify the University of a change of address within five
class days after the change becomes effective, will be considered as
falsification of University records. (Change of off-campus address is
made on the web at _www.reg.msu.edu_. Change of on-campus address is
made in the office of the Community Director.)”
