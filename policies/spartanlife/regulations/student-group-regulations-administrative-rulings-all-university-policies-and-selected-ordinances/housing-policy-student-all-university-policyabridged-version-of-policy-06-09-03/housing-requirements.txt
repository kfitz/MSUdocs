HOUSING REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES


(Administrative Ruling)

In accordance with the Campus Living Services Policy, the following
stipulations apply:

1. FRESHMEN AND SOPHOMORES – All freshman and sophomore students,
including transfer students (0-55 credits accumulated), are required to
reside in University housing, with the following exceptions:¹

a. Married students
b. Students who will be twenty years of age by the first day of classes
of fall semester of the current academic year (the current academic year
is fall semester and spring semester)
c. Veterans with one or more years of active service
d. Students living with parents or legal guardian
e. Students taking 6 or less credits during the semester in question

2. JUNIORS AND SENIORS – Juniors and seniors are encouraged to live on
campus. Moreover, the University will always seek to achieve some
balance of juniors and seniors in each housing unit.

ENFORCEMENT
Those students for whom the housing requirement is a condition of
enrollment will be asked to verify their adherence to it. Failure to
maintain the required residency could result in termination of
enrollment by the Division of Student Affairs and Services. Enforcement
of the housing regulations is the responsibility of the Division of
Student Affairs and Services. The housing requirement does not apply to
students during a semester in which they are enrolled for 6 or less
credits or during the summer semester. In any subsequent semester during
which the student carries 7 or more credits the requirement will again
become applicable.

ADDRESS
Every student is required to report his or her correct local address at
the time of registration and to report any change of address thereafter.
Failure to register the actual address at which he or she is living, or
failure to notify the University of a change of address within five
class days after the change becomes effective, will be considered as
falsification of University records. (Change of off-campus address is
made on the web at _www.reg.msu.edu_. Change of on-campus address is
made in the office of the Community Director.)

HOUSING CONTRACT
The Residence Education and Housing Services housing contracts are in
effect for the period stated in terms of the contract. Any student,
regardless of class standing, is obligated to fulfill the duration of
the housing contract unless an authorized release is obtained. (Note:
Applications for release must be made through the Housing Assignments
Office or the Community Director offices.) This regulation applies to
all students (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, special and
graduate) who enter into a contract for on-campus housing.

ASSIGNMENT
Only those persons who have received official housing assignments may
live in University housing.

SPECIAL PERMISSION
Any new student prior to moving into residence halls may apply for an
exception to the housing requirements. Information on the special
permission procedure and criteria for exceptions can be obtained by
contacting the Student Life Office, 101 Student Services Building.
Applications will be considered by a committee appointed by the Vice
President for Student Affairs and Services. The committee will have one
representative from each of the following offices: Department of Student
Life, Residence Education and Housing Services, and Associated Students
of Michigan State University. A student may appeal the decision of the
committee to the Vice President for Student Affairs and Services.

Off-campus living units that were recognized by the University as
“supervised” housing units in the Spring of 1983 will continue to be
eligible to house students consistent with past practice. Specific
conditions that will ensure this eligibility will be developed by the
Vice President for Student Affairs and Services and in consultation with
appropriate off-campus living units. The residents of these units must
be advised that the unit is neither supervised by nor under the
jurisdiction of the University and that the University assumes no
responsibility for the program, the facility, or persons associated with
the unit.

waived by administrative action on a yearly basis.
