PREFACE


COLLEGE OF LAW
Preface

The College of Law at Michigan State University shares with the rest of
the University the commitment to free inquiry and pursuit of knowledge
that marks the academic institution. Students enrolled in the
professional curricula of the College of Law are collectively referred
to in this document as “law students.” This document and related
documents, including:

• Michigan State University Student Rights and Responsibilities

o
(_http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/student-rights-and-responsibilities-at-michigan-state-university_)

• Academic Hearing Procedures for Michigan State University College of
Law

o
(_https://www.law.msu.edu/engagement/handbook/academic_hearing_procedures_for_msu_col.html_)

• Code of Student Discipline

o (_http://www.law.msu.edu/engagement/handbook/code-discipline.html_)

contain guidelines to the rights and responsibilities of law students in
matters of conduct, professionalism and ethics, academic pursuits,
keeping of records, and employment. This document describes structures
and procedures for interpreting and amending the guidelines described
herein, for formulating regulations governing law student conduct, for
adjudicating law student disciplinary cases not arising under the Code
of Student Discipline, and for channeling law student complaints,
grievances, or concerns to faculty, staff, and administrators for
appropriate action.

The College of Law educates students for careers in the legal profession
and evaluates students on their professional and ethical behavior as
well as on other elements of their academic performance. This dual focus
has been incorporated into this document. When disputes or complaints
arise regarding law student rights and responsibilities, the academic
tradition of the University and the professional and ethical traditions
of the legal profession generally allow for the differences to be
settled quickly and informally. This document is intended, in part, to
address those instances when a formal mechanism for adjudicating
differences must be instituted.
