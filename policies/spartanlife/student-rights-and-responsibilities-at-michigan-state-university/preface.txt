PREFACE


This report, the _Graduate Student Rights and Responsibilities_
document, the _Law Student Rights and Responsibilities_ document, and
the _Medical Student Rights and Responsibilities_ document contain
guidelines to the rights and duties of students in matters of conduct,
academic pursuits, the keeping of records, and publications. This report
describes structures and procedures for the formulation of regulations
governing student conduct, for the interpretation and amendment of the
guidelines, for the adjudication of student disciplinary cases, and for
channeling student complaints, grievances, or concerns to faculty,
staff, and administrators for appropriate action.

For the most part, these provisions simply make explicit what has been
long understood and practiced at Michigan State University. This report
identifies rights and duties of students and provides for students a
carefully prescribed system of due process. The report does not contain
a general or abstract definition of academic freedom. Rather, the report
is an operational definition with concrete application of the concept of
academic freedom for students.
