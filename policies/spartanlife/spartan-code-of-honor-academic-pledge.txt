SPARTAN CODE OF HONOR ACADEMIC PLEDGE


THE SPARTAN CODE OF HONOR: ACADEMIC PLEDGE

Michigan State University affirms the principle that all individuals
associated with the academic community have a responsibility for
establishing, maintaining, and fostering an understanding and
appreciation for academic integrity.  Academic integrity is the
foundation for university success.  Learning how to express original
ideas, cite works, work independently, and report results accurately and
honestly are skills that carry students beyond their academic career.

The Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge embodies the principles of
academic integrity through a personal commitment to ethical behavior in
a student’s studies and research.  All undergraduate students are
expected to uphold the academic pledge throughout their enrollment at
MSU.  Student conduct that is inconsistent with the academic pledge is
addressed through existing policies, regulations, and ordinances
governing academic honesty and integrity.  Those policies include:

-   Integrity of Scholarships and Grades Policy
-   Student Rights and Responsibilities
-   General Student Regulations (includes Protection of Scholarship and
    Grades)
-   Ordinance 17.00 Examinations

Students are encouraged to review the following websites to learn more
about academic integrity, student rights and responsibilities, and the
Spartan Code of Honor:

-   Spartan Life Handbook (Student Affairs)
-   University Ombudsperson
-   ASMSU

The Spartan Code of Honor was adopted by ASMSU on March 3, 2016,
endorsed by Academic Governance on March 22, 2016, and recognized by the
Provost, President, and Board of Trustees on April 15, 2016.

THE SPARTAN CODE OF HONOR ACADEMIC PLEDGE:

“​_AS A SPARTAN, I WILL STRIVE TO UPHOLD VALUES OF THE HIGHEST ETHICAL
STANDARD. I WILL PRACTICE HONESTY IN MY WORK, FOSTER HONESTY IN MY
PEERS, AND TAKE PRIDE IN KNOWING THAT HONOR IN OWNERSHIP IS WORTH MORE
THAN GRADES. I WILL CARRY THESE VALUES BEYOND MY TIME AS A STUDENT AT
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, CONTINUING THE ENDEAVOR TO BUILD PERSONAL
INTEGRITY IN ALL THAT I DO.​”_
