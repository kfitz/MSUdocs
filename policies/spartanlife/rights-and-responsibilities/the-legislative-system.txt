THE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM


Michigan State University maintains three levels of regulations
applicable to student conduct, all of which require student approval. In
addition, there are rulings established by administrative offices and
policies and ordinances established by the Board of Trustees.
Information regarding the process through which the various regulations
and policies are enacted is indicated below.

GENERAL STUDENT REGULATIONS
STUDENT GROUP REGULATIONS
LIVING GROUP REGULATIONS
ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS
ALL-UNIVERSITY POLICIES

The above types of regulations, rulings, and policies are enacted in
accordance with Article 5 of _Michigan State University Student Rights
and Responsibilities_. A brief description of each may also be found
under “Types of Rules.” References for further information include:

a. _Bylaws of the Board of Trustees_, Articles IV, VI, and VIII
b. _Bylaws for Academic Governance_, Articles 2, 4 and 5
c. _ASMSU Constitution_ and _Code of Operation_
d. _COGS Constitution and Bylaws_
e. Major governing group constitutions
f. Living unit constitutions

MSU ORDINANCES – The Board of Trustees is granted authority by the
constitution of the State of Michigan to legislate ordinances governing
the conduct of all persons on University property. These ordinances are
law, violations of which are misdemeanors and adjudicated through the
courts. The legislative process need not involve anyone except the Board
of Trustees, although in practice the administration contributes its
advice and relevant student-faculty committees may also be consulted.

REFERENCES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:
a. _MSU Ordinances_
b. _Bylaws of the Board of Trustees_, Article XI

ACADEMIC REGULATION – Matters of academic policy, program and degree
requirements are available in the following sources:

a. MSU Catalog – _Academic Programs_
b. MSU Catalog – _Description of Courses_

In addition to consulting these sources, students should contact the
academic department of their major preference for specific program
requirements.
