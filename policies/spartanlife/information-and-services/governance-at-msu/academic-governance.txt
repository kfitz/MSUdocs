ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE


The Academic Governance system includes committees and councils at the
department, college and all-University levels. Each has a responsibility
to consider matters of academic and educational policy relating to the
specific function of the committee and/or council. Please visit the
Academic Governance website at _http://acadgov.msu.edu_.

ASMSU
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, composed of elected representatives from each
undergraduate college, representatives from each Council of Progressive
Students group and Council of Racial and Ethnic Student group, and each
Major Governing Group, is responsible for appointing undergraduate
student members to many Academic Governance committees and councils at
the University level.

UNIVERSITY COUNCIL
THE UNIVERSITY COUNCIL, composed of faculty, administrators and students
is the highest body to consider issues concerning academic programs and
procedures of the University. It also approves general student
regulations and general statements on student rights and
responsibilities. All operations are guided by the _Bylaws for Academic
Governance_. (See Section 3.2, in the _Bylaws for Academic Governance._)

UNIVERSITY-LEVEL STANDING COMMITTEES
UNIVERSITY-LEVEL STANDING COMMITTEES have student members appointed by
the ASMSU Academic Assembly. (See Article 4.2, in the _Bylaws for
Academic Governance_.)

UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE conducts a continuing review
of the Bylaws and is responsible for recommending amendments of these
Bylaws to the University Council. The Committee also reviews the _Bylaws
at the College level._ Seven positions are open to students. (See
Section 4.3, in the _Bylaws for Academic Governance._)

UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION consults with the
Provost’s Office about changes in academic programs and procedures. Six
positions are open to students. (See Section 4.4, in the _Bylaws for
Academic Governance._)

UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON CURRICULUM reviews and approves or rejects
changes in undergraduate courses, curricula, and degree requirements
proposed by academic units. Seven positions are open to students. (See
Section 4.5, in the _Bylaws for Academic Governance._)

UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON FACULTY TENURE_ _advises the Provost on
procedures to be used in granting tenure or dismissing a faculty member.
Three positions are open to students. (See Section 4.7, in the _Bylaws
for Academic Governance.)_

UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS advises the Division of Student
Affairs and Services on policies as they affect achievement; initiates
and reviews amendments to the _Student Rights and Responsibilities_ and
_General Student Regulations._ Seven positions are open to students.
(See Section 4.9, in the _Bylaws for Academic Governance.)_
