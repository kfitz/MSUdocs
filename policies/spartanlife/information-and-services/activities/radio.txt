RADIO


WDBM “IMPACT 89FM” broadcasts the best music, sports, news, and
entertainment 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. On the radio dial at 88.9
FM, streaming online at _http://impact89fm.org/listenlive_ and available
as streaming app in iOS and Android (links at
_http://impact89fm.org/app/_). A passionate and diverse group of
students run the commercial-free station and associated social media
platforms. Over 200 volunteers hold positions as DJs, talk show hosts,
campus news and sports reporters, videographers, audio editors, music
reviewers, street-team marketers, and web authors. “The Impact” has won
Michigan’s “College Radio Station of the Year” award 14 times and has
received national attention as one of America’s top College stations
from mtvU and the College Music Journal (CMJ).

WFIX, “THE FIX”, is the internet-streaming station found at:
_http://thefix.org_. WFIX is the main training ground for WDBM.

The goal of student radio is to create a vibrant community of students
who inspire and encourage through diverse and professional programming.
This creates an experience-based learning laboratory where all students
develop applied skills that future employers will recognize and value.
Both stations are supported by a fee collected from all students each
semester. Students of all majors may apply for paid positions or to work
as volunteers. Offices and studios in G-4 Holden Hall are accessible.
For information call (517) 884-8900. Website: _http://impact89fm.org_.
