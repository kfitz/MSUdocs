GREEK AFFAIRS


Since 1872, MSU students have had the choice of participating in
nationally affiliated Greek letter organizations. Today, the Greek
community is comprised of 60 (inter)nationally affiliated Greek letter
organizations with a combined membership of approximately 4,000+
students.

The value of Greek life for students who choose to participate is the
merging of almost every element of the campus experience into one
cohesive program; leadership development, academic achievement,
community service, sports, social life, housing, alumni relations, and
self-governance.
