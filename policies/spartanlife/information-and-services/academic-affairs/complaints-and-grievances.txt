COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES


OFFICE OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSPERSON: The University Ombudsperson is an
official, chosen from among senior faculty, to whom students at all
levels may appeal for assistance in resolving complaints involving
academic or non-academic matters. The University Ombudsperson has broad
powers of investigation, including direct and ready access to University
officers, faculty, and official records. Operating in a confidential,
independent and neutral manner, the University Ombudsperson assesses the
validity of each complaint, advises on possible remedies, and, where
indicated, actively assists students in resolving their disputes. The
University Ombudsperson also assists students in requesting formal
academic grievance hearings in situations where students remain
dissatisfied with suggested resolutions. Contact at: Office of the
University Ombudsperson, 354 Farm Lane, Room N129, N. Kedzie Hall,
Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824; (517)353-8830,
