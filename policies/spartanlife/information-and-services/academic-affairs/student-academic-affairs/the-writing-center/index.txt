THE WRITING CENTER


The Writing Center staff consults with writers at all levels of
proficiency, at all stages of the composing process, and on a wide
variety of composing projects including essays, resumes, presentations,
websites, and digital movies. Visit our website at
_http://writing.msu.edu_ to set up an appointment at one of our various
sites across campus, including all neighborhoods, the main library, and
online. When space is available, all locations take drop-in clients on a
first-come, first-served basis.
