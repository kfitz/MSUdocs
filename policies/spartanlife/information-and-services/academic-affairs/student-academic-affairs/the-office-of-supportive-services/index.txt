THE OFFICE OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES


The Office of Supportive Services (OSS) is a multifaceted holistic
initiative designed to address the needs of TRIO students; first
generation, income eligible, students with disabilities and students who
meet other priority participant criteria. Through the collaborative
efforts of MSU faculty and staff, the Supportive Services personnel
implement an intensive and comprehensive service. Students have access
to program services from the time they enter the University, through
graduation and placement into graduate school. The primary goal of OSS
is to assist in the retention and graduation rates of program
participants. This is accomplished by offering a variety of services
which foster student academic achievement, self-confidence and
leadership.

For more information about OSS and TRIO, please call (517) 353-5210 or
visit us at 209 Bessey Hall or online at _http://trio.oss.msu.edu/_.
