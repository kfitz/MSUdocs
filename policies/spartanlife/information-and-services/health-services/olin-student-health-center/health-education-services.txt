Health Promotion challenges the health attitudes, behaviors, and

Collegiate Recovery Community (_http://olin.msu.edu/recovery/_).

NUTRITION COUNSELING (_http://olin.msu.edu/healthpromo/nutrition_)
Nutrition counseling appointments with a registered dietitian are
available to help students become competent with eating through an
individualized, collaborative approach. During the initial appointment,

a weight-inclusive approach to stabilize eating and enhance health.
Students can receive support for a wide variety of nutrition concerns,
and there is no fee for nutrition appointments.
