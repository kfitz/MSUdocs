24 HOUR PHONE INFORMATION NURSE: (517) 353-5557


The 24-hour phone information nurse is available to help make decisions
when:

-   A student isn’t sure whether symptoms require medical attention.
-   It’s late at night and a student doesn’t know whether to go to
    Urgent Care, the ER or if the symptoms can be treated the next day
    in a doctor’s office.

Health-related questions are answered by registered nurses who have been
specifically trained for “phone triage”. Call (517) 353-5557.
