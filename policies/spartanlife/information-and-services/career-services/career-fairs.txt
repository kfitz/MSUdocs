CAREER FAIRS


One of the best things you can do for yourself in your job or internship
search is to make personal connections with employers. Career fairs give
students and employers the opportunity to talk directly to each other
about openings, learn about career fields and areas of interest, and
gain advice on job and internship searches. Career fairs and other
special information programs are held throughout the year in a variety
of campus locations. A list of career fairs is available at
_http://CareerNetwork.msu.edu/jobs-internships/Career-Fairs/index.html_
and your _Handshake_ account.
