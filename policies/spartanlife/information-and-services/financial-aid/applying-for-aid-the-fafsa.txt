APPLYING FOR AID: THE FAFSA


The Office of Financial Aid offers a variety of grant, work, and loan
programs to give financial options to all families, no matter what their
need or resources. You should file a Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for both need-based and non-need-based aid
at MSU. This free form is used nationwide to determine aid eligibility
by collecting income, asset, and demographic data about the student and
family. File for aid as early as possible. Complete the application
online at _www.fafsa.gov._ View FAFSA Tips for more information about
when to apply go to _finaid.msu.edu/tips.asp_.
