WORKING AT MSU


A student employee is a part-time employee who is enrolled at MSU, is
registered for classes and whose primary purpose for being at the
university is the achievement of a degree or certification. During the
summer semester, an individual may be a student employee if s/he has
been admitted/readmitted and is enrolled for summer and/or fall semester
classes. Student employees are considered at-will employees and their
employment is interim and temporary and incidental to the pursuit of a
degree or certification.
