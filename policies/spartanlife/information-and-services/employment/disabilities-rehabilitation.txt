DISABILITIES, REHABILITATION


AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT
OF 1973 AND THE MICHIGAN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act (504), and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities
Civil Rights Act (MPDCRA), qualified applicants and employees with
disabilities are protected from discrimination in hiring, promotion,
discharge, pay, job training, benefits and other aspects of employment.
These laws provide that qualified individuals with a disability must be
provided with reasonable accommodations that do not impose undue
hardship.

The MPDCRA requires an employee to request accommodation within 182 days
from the date the employee discovered or should have discovered the need
for accommodation. Failure to notify the employer of this need within
182 days releases the employer from its obligation to accommodate under
the MPDCRA. The employer is not released from its obligation to
accommodate under ADA and Section 504; however, complaints alleging
discrimination prohibited by the ADA and 504 must be filed within time
limits set forth in the statutes and implementing regulations.

The ADA, Section 504 and the MPDCRA also provide that each University
program, service and activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be
accessible unless assuring accessibility would fundamentally alter the
program, service or activity.

Questions should be directed to MSU Student Employment at (517)
355-9520.
