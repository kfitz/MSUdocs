EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION FOR STUDENT EMPLOYEES


IMMIGRATION REFORM AND CONTROL ACT OF 1986

Since June 1, 1987, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has
required that all individuals hired for paid employment in the United
States after November 6, 1986, must complete Section 1 of the I-9 Form,
Employment Eligibility Verification
(_https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/i9/index.html_) on or before the first day
of employment. In addition to completion of the I-9 Form, a W-4 will
need to be completed. Original, unexpired documents from either List A
or List B and C must be presented to the verifier within three business
days of the first day of employment.

Students who plan to work must provide evidence of their identity, and
work authorization to comply with federal laws. For a List of Acceptable
I-9 documents, please visit _https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/i9/index.html._

Student employment questions may be directed to the MSU HR Solutions
Center at (517) 353-4434.
