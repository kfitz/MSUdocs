MICHIGAN RIGHT-TO-KNOW LAW


The Michigan Right-to-Know Law requires that all employees who may be
exposed to hazardous chemicals receive chemical safety awareness
training. Student employees who are known to be, or who could
potentially be, exposed to hazardous chemicals must be informed of their
rights under the law and of specific safety procedures necessary to work
with these materials. Student employees who are not working with
hazardous chemicals or who have a low probability of exposure must also
be informed that they may request the same training concerning their
rights under the law. This may be accomplished in the same manner used
for other employees; written communications, video presentations, and
in-house training. Environmental Health and Safety should be contacted
at (517) 355-0153 or ehs@msu.edu for additional information and
assistance regarding video presentations and training.
