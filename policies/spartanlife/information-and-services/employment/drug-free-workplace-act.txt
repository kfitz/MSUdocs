DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE/DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS


The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools
and Communities Act Amendment of 1989 apply to MSU. In compliance with
these laws, the University maintains a _Drug and Alcohol Policy_
applicable to all students and employees, which prohibits the unlawful
manufacture, distribution, possession, or use of controlled substance,
illicit drugs, and alcohol. Students are advised to be familiar with
this _policy_.
