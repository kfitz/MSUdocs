MSU STUDENT FOOD BANK


The MSU Student Food Bank serves registered graduate and undergraduate
MSU students who do not have an RHS meal plan and who are in need of
supplemental food and necessities. Students must provide proof of
registration at the beginning of each semester and must present their
current MSU student ID upon each visit to the Food Bank. Food is free of
charge and distributed biweekly on Wednesdays from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at
the Olin Health Center cafeteria. (Enter on the west side of the
building.) Contact: foodbank@msu.edu, call (517) 432-5136, or check out
