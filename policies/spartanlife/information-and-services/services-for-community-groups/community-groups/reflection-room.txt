REFLECTION ROOM


THE MSU REFLECTION ROOM, located in 1277 Anthony Hall, provides a quiet
space for individual reflection, meditation, and prayer. The ecumenical
environment welcomes all and embraces understanding and the furthering
of knowledge associated with differing perspectives. We believe the MSU
value of inclusion is evident in the unity of spiritual reflection and
connection that can occur in this space. The harmony of the MSU
community allows us to personify co-existence in this space. The
Reflection Room is open during the regular building hours as posted. For
students residing in the Brody Neighborhood there are additional
Reflection Rooms located in the following spaces: (You must be a
resident of the hall to access these spaces.)

C210B Bryan Hall
C210B Armstrong Hall
C200B Butterfield Hall (has a foot bath)
