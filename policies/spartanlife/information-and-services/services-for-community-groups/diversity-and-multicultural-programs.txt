DIVERSITY AND MULTICULTURAL PROGRAMS


The PROVOST/VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS, the VICE PRESIDENT FOR
FINANCE AND OPERATIONS, and the VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS AND
SERVICES share responsibility for providing pluralism, diversity, and
multicultural programs. The University’s holistic approach includes such
themes as gender, racial-ethnic minorities, disabilities, and sexual
orientation. The Coalition of Racial/Ethnic Minorities (COREM) serves in
an advisory and advocacy capacity on faculty and staff issues.

THE OFFICE OF CULTURAL AND ACADEMIC TRANSITIONS (OCAT)
Constructs supportive social and educational communities that actively
involve students in learning. Specifically, we prompt students’
involvement in broad-based University learning experiences (e.g.,
neighborhood concept, study-abroad, alternative spring break,
internships, etc.), while also connecting them to campus resources,
people, and programs that lead to deeper student learning and personal
success. In part, the Office accomplishes this mission by building
critical alliances and links to academic units. Additionally, OCAT helps
students to better understand themselves and others through cultural and
social activities. _Student-to-student interaction is the key to
benefiting from diversity_, and OCAT strives to bring together
individuals as well as groups of students from diverse racial, ethnic,
international, and domestic backgrounds for meaningful interactions.
Moreover, OCAT supports individual students in their navigation of
cross-cultural encounters, and in their own understanding, exploration
and development of cultural identity. OCAT employs multiple strategies
to accomplish these goals. A few of OCAT’s signature programs include
the Intercultural Aides, the Maximizing Academic Growth in College
program (MAGIC), the Dia de la Mujer (DDLM), the Focus
Conference, and Spartan Re-mix. View our website at _www.ocat.msu.edu_.
