LATE NIGHT SERVICE 2 A.M. TO 7 A.M. (9 A.M. WEEKENDS)


NIGHT OWL SERVICE: This is an on-campus, demand response service. Dial
(517) 432-8888 from any phone, or use one of MSU’s Green Light phones
located across campus, to request a ride from that spot to another
campus location. A bus will arrive at your curb within 20 minutes. If
you need to travel on campus during the wee hours, you have a safe way
to get where you need to go!
