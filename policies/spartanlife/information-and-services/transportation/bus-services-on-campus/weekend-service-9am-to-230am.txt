WEEKEND SERVICE 9 A.M. TO 2:30 A.M.


ROUTES 34, 35, AND 36: three fixed routes offer weekend service. Buses
run every 30 minutes on the weekends. Each route serves a specific area
of campus. All three routes connect at the MSU-CATA Transportation
Center for convenient transfers.

LOT LINK: provides weekend curb-to-curb transportation between Student
Parking Lots #83, 89 or 91 and another campus location. Dial (517)
432-8888 from any campus phone when you are ready for a ride. A small
bus will arrive within 20 minutes of your call to take you to your
campus destination. No advance reservations will be accepted. Rides are
restricted to campus only and each trip must begin or end at one of the
three lots.
