**Overview**

This section presents an overview of benefit and retirement programs
available to employees and eligible dependents. Although Michigan State
University expects to continue the benefit programs indefinitely, it
reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate such coverages in
whole or in part at any time, except as limited by the terms and
conditions or master contracts and/or collective bargaining agreements.
Payment of benefits is conditional upon eligibility requirements, and in
some cases an application to participate in the plan is required.
Special notations are provided regarding part-time (50-89.9 percent)
employees. Complete information may be obtained from [MSU Human
Resources](/benefits/index.html "Benefits") at 517-353-4434,
800-353-4434, or <solutionscenter@hr.msu.edu>. If there is any
misunderstanding regarding any of the programs described below, the
provisions of the master contracts on file will prevail.
