**Institutional Data Policy**

The University community and external communities have expectations
regarding the appropriate and ethical uses of data and their stewardship
that are critical to MSU\'s ability to maintain public trust and
confidence.  Michigan State University needs to protect the security and
integrity of its institutional data without hindering the effective and
efficient use of those Data. Therefore, it is important that everyone
working with data at MSU be aware of specific legal, policy and
contractual requirements applicable to these data. The Institutional
Data Policy establishes minimum requirements for the appropriate
stewardship of Institutional Data. View [the Institutional Data
Policy](https://tech.msu.edu/about/guidelines-policies/msu-institutional-data-policy/ "Institutional Data Policy").
