**Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law
that protects the privacy of student education records. The University
maintains student education records and is responsible for their access
and release in accordance with FERPA. It is the policy of the University
to comply with FERPA. The MSU Access to Student Information Guidelines
govern the procedures for the maintenance and disclosure of information
from student education records held by the University. All University
employees with access to student education records have an obligation to
comply with FERPA and read the [MSU Access to Student Information
Guidelines](https://reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/Text.aspx?Section=112#s542 "Access to Student Information Guidelines").

For additional information on or questions about FERPA, contact the
Office of the Registrar at 517-355-3300 or <reg@msu.edu>.
