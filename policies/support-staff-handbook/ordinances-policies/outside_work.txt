**Work Outside the University and Conflicts of Interest**

Work outside the University is not prohibited, but it must not interfere
with performance of the duties and responsibilities of the University
position, nor may it create a conflict of interest. A conflict of
interest exists when an employee's financial interests or other
opportunities for tangible personal benefit may compromise, or
reasonably appear to compromise, the independence of judgment with which
the employee performs his/her responsibilities at the University.
