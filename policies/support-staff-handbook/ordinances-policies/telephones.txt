**Telephones**

University telephones must be kept free for business and emergency use.
Contact the unit supervisor for rules and procedures regarding use of
department telephones for personal use.

Personal cell phones should be used during off-duty times (i.e., lunch
break) and should not interfere with an employee's performance of job
responsibilities.
