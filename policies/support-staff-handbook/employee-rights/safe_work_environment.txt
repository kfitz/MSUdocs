**Safe and Healthy Work Environment**

Michigan State University strives to provide a safe and healthy
environment for all faculty, staff, students, and visitors.

The Office of Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Safety (ORCBS)
anticipates, recognizes, evaluates, and controls occupational and
environmental hazards as they pertain to the campus use, transportation,
storage, and disposal of radioactive, chemical, and biohazardous
materials. For more information about ORCBS, visit the [Office of
Radiation, Chemical, and Biological
Safety](http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/) website.

Support and enforcement of the Michigan Right-to-Know Law requirements
is the responsibility of the unit. Internal unit audits are conducted to
monitor compliance, and periodic reports, as required, are submitted to
ORCBS.

Supervisors shall maintain the Michigan Right-to-Know Law requirements
at the employee level. This maintenance includes, but is not limited to,
specific training for employees on the potential chemical hazards that
may exist in the workplace area.

Employees shall comply with University requirements and specific
training instructions pertaining to the Michigan Right-to-Know Law, in
addition to other relevant health and safety laws and guidelines.

Employees must report to their respective supervisor, unit, or ORCBS any
safety or health concern involving radiation, chemicals, or biological
safety. Any emergency situation should be reported by telephoning 9-1-1
immediately.

**Drugs and Alcohol**

The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on October
12, 1990:

Consistent with state and federal law, Michigan State University will
maintain a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution,
dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance. The unlawful
manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of
controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol are prohibited on any
property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of
Michigan State University and at any site where work is performed by
individuals on behalf of Michigan State University. Pursuant to
applicable University procedures governing employee discipline, any
employee involved in the unlawful use, sale, manufacturing, dispensing,
or possession of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol on
University premises or work sites, or working under the influence of
such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including dismissal and referral for prosecution. The employee must
notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a
violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) calendar
days after such conviction. Failure to provide such notice will subject
the employee to discipline up to and including dismissal pursuant to
applicable University procedures governing employee discipline. The
employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, who will report the
incident to the Office of Human Resources, Academic Human Resources, or
Student Employment Office.

Michigan State University supports and sponsors programs aimed at the
prevention of substance abuse by University employees. The Employee
Assistance Program (EAP) provides preventative programs and counseling
for employees experiencing substance-dependency problems. View more
information on [EAP programs](http://eap.msu.edu/ "EAP Programs").
Assistance is available on a voluntary basis. Leaves of absence to
obtain treatment may be obtained under the medical leave provision of
the appropriate collective bargaining agreement or policy. View
MSU's [Drug-Free Workplace
policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/drug-free_workplace.html "Drug Free Workplace Policy")
or the [Collective bargaining
agreements](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html "Union Contracts").

**Smoke-Free Policy**

The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 16,
1993:

Compelling scientific finds ... indicate that the simple separation of
buildings into "smoking" and "nonsmoking" sections does not eliminate
the unequivocal health risks that result from environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS). In light of these findings, Michigan State University is
committed to eliminating harmful exposures to environmental tobacco
smoke unwanted by students, faculty, staff, and visitors and adopts the
following smoke-free policy.

1.  Smoking will not be permitted in any closed space, regardless of
    location, except specifically designated private residential space
    and hotel rooms. Smoking is permitted outside of buildings and
    should be 25 feet away from exits and entrances, unless otherwise
    designated.
2.  Cigarettes and other tobacco products will not be sold on University
    grounds.
3.  This smoke-free policy applies to all MSU facilities and vehicles,
    owned or leased.

Questions, problems, and complaints regarding this policy should be
handled through existing departmental administrative channels and
administrative procedures, including the Housing Options Committee.
Persons found to have violated this policy will be subject to
disciplinary actions in the same manner and magnitude as violations of
other University policies.

The success of this policy will depend on the thoughtfulness,
consideration, and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers. All employees
share in the responsibility for adhering to and enforcing this policy.

Smoking cessation programs and materials are available through
[Health4U](http://health4u.msu.edu/ "Health4U website") and Olin Health
Center to assist persons who wish to quit smoking.

**Safety**

The University Physician's Office has oversight for the health and
safety policy for the University community, with a wide variety of
health-related programs and initiatives. For more information, telephone
517-353-8933 or visit the [University Physician\'s
Office](http://www.uphys.msu.edu/ "University Physician's Office") online.

Employees are expected to comply with University health, safety, and
fire rules and regulations. Where appropriate, supervisors will inform
employees of special health and safety guidelines. The University will
provide protective clothing and equipment when necessary to fulfill job
requirements. If an on-the-job injury or illness occurs, or if an unsafe
condition exists, it should be immediately reported to the supervisor
for appropriate action. Questions regarding occupational safety should
be referred to the supervisor, to Occupational Health, or to the
director of environmental safety.  Questions regarding fire safety
should be referred to the Fire Marshal in the Investigative Division of
the MSU Police Department at 517-355-2222 or by visiting the [MSU Police
Department](http://www.police.msu.edu/ "MSU Police") online.

The MSU Occupational Health Service works with University departments to
ensure a healthy work environment on campus and provides for the medical
surveillance of employees who may be exposed to chemical or biological
hazards. Occupational health at MSU also offers health information to
faculty and staff and other health-related services for employees. For
more information, please visit the [Occupational Health
website](http://uphys.msu.edu/unit/occhealth/index.html "Occupational Health") or
call 517-353-9137.

**Drug Free Workplace Act**

The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 applies to MSU and all of
its employees, including student employees. Consistent with state and
federal law, Michigan State University maintains a workplace free from
the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use
of a controlled substance. Such behavior is prohibited on any property
under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan
State University and at any site where work is performed by individuals
on behalf of Michigan State University. These prohibitions also apply to
employees performing safety sensitive functions and whose position
responsibilities require they obtain a commercial driver's license.

Employees who violate University policy prohibiting the use or
possession of illegal drugs are subject to disciplinary action through
the appropriate disciplinary process. For additional information, please
see the [University Policy and
Procedure](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/Alchohol-Controlled-Substances.html "University Policy on Alcohol and Controlled Substances") or
the [Human Resources Policy and
Procedure](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/drugs_alcohol.html "Support Staff Drug and Alcohol Policy").

**Medical Marijuana Act**

The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the "Act") became Michigan law on
December 4, 2008. The Act permits an individual with a qualifying
debilitating medical condition to register as a medical marijuana
patient with the Michigan Department of Community Health ("MDCH") and
avoid criminal penalties under state law for certain medical uses of
marijuana. Information about the Act and the state registry program is
available on the [MDCH](http://www.michigan.gov/mmp) website.

In order to meet its obligations under federal law to maintain a drug
free workplace, University policy regarding marijuana remains the same.
Employees may not use or possess marijuana on any University property or
in the course of employment. University policy also prohibits employees
from reporting to work under the influence of a controlled substance,
such as marijuana. This is true whether the marijuana is smoked or
ingested through other means. For additional information regarding
the [Alcohol and Controlled Substances
Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/drugs_alcohol.html "Support Staff Drug and Alcohol Policy"),
please look online.

**Driver Certification**

In certain positions, an employee may be required to operate a
University vehicle or equipment as part of his/her job functions. In
those cases, employees will be required to complete a Driver
Certification Form to certify that he/she meets the necessary
requirements. For additional information, please see [MSU\'s Manual of
Business
Procedures](http://ctlr.msu.edu/combp/ "MSU Manual of Business Procedures") (Section
70) which is available online.

**Emergency Situations**

Emergency situations refer to severe weather, a long-term power outage,
a fire, a tornado, man-made and natural disasters, or a declared \"state
of emergency\" situation.

In the event of a major campus emergency, the University media
coordinator, under the direction of the President of the University and
the Director of Police Department, will disseminate warning information
through the appropriate media.

In cases of prolonged emergency situations, the level of services
appropriate to the functioning of the University and the needs and
levels of employee involvement will be determined by the unit
administration in order to protect the health and safety of human and
animal life and the basic security of the University\'s physical plant
and equipment.

situations](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/emergency_situations.html "Emergency Situations"), please
