**Careers**

**Performance Excellence Program\
**

Employees and supervisors engage in performance review discussions prior
to the completion of the probationary period and thereafter on at least
an annual basis. This review process provides an opportunity for the
employee and supervisor to discuss the employee's performance and
development. This process can be a successful communication and
development tool when both the supervisor and employee actively and
constructively take part. For more information on performance reviews,

[here](https://www.hr.msu.edu/PerformanceExcellence/index.html "Performance Excellence").

**Promotions and Transfers**

It is University policy to fill vacancies by promotion from within the
University community whenever possible. It is sometimes necessary or
desirable to employ persons from outside the University. Transfers and
promotions are based on many factors, including the ability to do the
work.

**Eligibility**: All University employees who have completed sufficient
service years as specified in University policy or collective bargaining
agreements are eligible to apply for a transfer or promotion.

**Procedures**: To ensure an orderly and equitable process, the
University has adopted, and requires adherence to, the following
procedures:

-   Job postings are generated weekly and are available
    [here](https://www.hr.msu.edu/employment/ "MSU Employment Opportunities").
-   Employees must complete an application and apply for job vacancies
    through the appropriate job website.

**Other**:

-   Employees will be given reasonable time off from their jobs for the
    purpose of interviewing for another University position.
    Arrangements must be made in advance with their supervisors.
-   Interviews are not necessarily granted to all applicants applying
    for a position.
-   Employees selected for transfers or promotions must complete a
    probationary or trial period during which time the employee\'s
    ability to perform the work and the employee\'s desire to remain on
    the job will be considered. Duration of the probationary or trial
    period varies among employee groups as outline in the
    applicable [Collective Bargaining
    Agreement](/contracts/index.html "Union Contracts").
-   It is the University's expectation that all employees possess basic
    computer skills.

**Recognition of Service**

The University recognizes continuous service of individual staff
members. As an expression of appreciation, the University holds a
convocation program each year to honor employees with extended years of
service, beginning with 15 years of service to the University. Employees
who attend the annual awards ceremony to be recognized will be given
reasonable time off with pay if scheduled to work at the time of the
event. For additional information on the Service Recognition Program,
