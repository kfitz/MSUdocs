Support Staff

**Separation**

**Dismissal for Cause**

**Reduction in Force**

It is university policy to endeavor to provide continuing, stable
employment. From time to time, a reduction in the work force may be
necessary due to a lack of work, lack of funds and/or other causes.
Generally, this reduction will be accomplished through normal attrition.
If it is not, the university follows a prescribed layoff procedure. View

the policy and procedure, refer to the [collective bargaining
agreements](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html "Union Contracts").
