Support Staff

**Termination**

**Reduction in Force**

It is University policy to endeavor to provide continuing, stable
employment. From time to time, a reduction in the work force may be
necessary due to a lack of work, lack of funds and/or other causes.
Generally, this reduction will be accomplished through normal attrition.
If it is not, the University follows a prescribed layoff procedure. View
[information on the reduction in force policy and
procedure](https://hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/rif.html "Reduction in Force"),
or review the [collective bargaining
agreements](https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html "Collective Bargaining Argreements").

**Resignation/Voluntary Termination**

Administrative professional and supervisory employees are expected to
give notification of intent to terminate at least one month in advance.
All other employees are expected to give departments at least two weeks'
notice.
