**Occupational Health and Safety Rules and Regulations**

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

All faculty and academic staff are required to comply with University,
state and federal occupational health and safety rules and regulations.
This requirement includes the appropriate use of personal protective
equipment and participation in safety training. Occupational health and
safety requirements specific to individual jobs are generally
communicated through unit chairs or department heads, but any questions
should be clarified by contacting the Office of Occupational Health or
the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. Failure to comply with
occupational health and safety rules and regulations may result in a
direct assessment of regulatory fines, workers compensation costs (to
units determined not to be in compliance), and/or in disciplinary action
of faculty/academic staff who fail to meet the requirements.\
