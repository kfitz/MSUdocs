**Confidentiality of Letters of Reference for Reappointment, Promotion
and Tenure Recommendations**

 Last updated: 12/2/1991

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on
December 2, 1991.*

University policy on confidentiality of letters of reference is that all
letters soliciting evaluation relative to reappointment, promotion, and
tenure recommendations must include the unit\'s statement on
confidentiality. Any deviation from the following statement must be less
restrictive and must be reviewed by the Provost\'s Office.

::: {xmlns=""}
> \"Your letter of evaluation, as part of an official review file, will
> be held in confidence and will not be disclosed to the faculty member
> under consideration or to the public except as required by law or
> University policy. In all such instances, the information made
> available will be provided in a form that seeks to protect the
> identity, privacy, and confidentiality of evaluators.\"
:::

In instances in which individual colleges, departments and schools wish
to deviate from the referenced policy, the expectation of the Office of
the Provost is that such policy deviations, which can only be less
restrictive, would be developed in consultation with duly constituted
faculty advisory groups as required by Section 2 of the Bylaws for
Academic Governance. In addition, it is expected that such college,
department, or school policies will be available to be reviewed by the
Office of the Provost in advance of their distribution, both within the
academic unit or to external reviewers. In this way there will be an
opportunity to ensure the conformance of the unit\'s policy with this
University policy and the law.\
