*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on June 11,
1993.*

The University may rescind a tenure system faculty member\'s appointment
for any material misrepresentation made in the course of seeking a
University appointment. In such cases, the faculty member shall be
advised, in writing, of the grounds for rescission and shall be provided
an opportunity to confer with the Provost in advance of any rescission
action. If the Provost decides to recommend rescission of the faculty
member\'s appointment, the faculty member shall be so notified in
writing. The faculty member may grieve the decision by filing a
grievance with the Faculty Grievance Official within thirty calendar
days of receipt of the Provost\'s written notification.

If no grievance is filed, the Provost shall forward the rescission
recommendation to the President for action by the Board of Trustees. If
a grievance is filed it will be heard by a University Hearing Panel
pursuant to the procedures in Section III.I. of the Faculty Grievance
Policy except that the Hearing Panel shall forward its recommendation
directly to the President. The University Hearing Panel shall include
three members of the UCFT. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Hearing Panel, the President shall act on recommendation and either (1)
retain the faculty member or (2) forward the matter to the Board of
Trustees for action.\
