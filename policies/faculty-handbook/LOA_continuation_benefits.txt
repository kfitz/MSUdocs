**Continuation of Benefits for Faculty on Leave of Absence No Pay Status
to Receive Prestigious Awards, Fellowships and/or Special Assignment
Opportunities**

 Last updated: 4/22/1987

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on May 6, 1985 and
revised on April 22, 1987.* ^1^

Michigan State University encourages continuing professional development
by faculty members. This encouragement takes many forms, e.g.,
substantial time as part of regular assignments devoted to scholarly,
research, and other creative activities; sabbatical leaves; an
environment supportive of scholarship such as a major research library.

Continuing professional development that is in the interest of both the
individual faculty member and the University may be facilitated when a
faculty member receives a prestigious award, fellowship, or special
assignment opportunity requiring a leave of absence without pay, with
partial pay or a reduction in percent employment below full-time,
normally for periods usually six months or longer.

Examples of prestigious awards, fellowships, and special assignment
opportunities for which leaves of absence without pay often are
requested include the following:

1.  Prestigious awards and/or fellowships provided by national and
    international organizations and foundations supporting research and
    scholarship broadly defined, for example, those provided by the
    National Endowment for the Arts/Humanities, Guggenheim Foundation,
    Fulbright Commission, Rockefeller Foundation, National Science
    Foundation, Social Science Research Council.
2.  Prestigious awards and/or fellowships provided by national and
    international organizations and foundations supporting research and
    scholarships in specific disciplines, for example, those provided by
    the Wenner-Green Foundation for Anthropological Research, Charles
    Warren Center (of Harvard University), Sloan Foundation, and Robert
    Wood Johnson Foundation.
3.  Assignments with international, national, and state public agencies
    and institutions, private businesses, foundations, and
    organizations, and professional associations.
4.  International faculty exchange programs and participation in
    teaching/scholarly activities with educational institutions in other
    countries with which Michigan State University has important formal
    cooperation or linkage agreements.

::: {xmlns=""}
There are instances when such awards, fellowships, and special
assignment opportunities, as a consequence of the policy of the source
institution, do not include benefits similar to those provided by
Michigan State University for full-time tenure system faculty.
:::

**Request Procedures**

On receipt of the above-referenced types of awards, fellowships, and
special assignment opportunities for which the source institution does
not provide applicable benefits, a tenure system faculty member may
request, with written endorsement of the applicable chairperson/director
and dean, that the Office of the Provost arrange with the Benefits
office for the continuation of the applicable University benefits (see
below) not provided by the source agency or institution. Such written
requests must provide a statement that the leave of absence without pay
is to accept a prestigious award, fellowship, or other special
assignment opportunity that is in the interest of both the individual
and the University. Information in support of the request must include:
a) specifics of the award/fellowship or assignment, including the
regular University benefits provided as well as not provided by the
source agency/institution; b) documentation from the source
agency/institution of its benefits policy; c) the specific assignment(s)
to be performed while on leave of absence without pay; and d) how the
activities entailed in the award, fellowship, or special assignment
opportunity advance the interests of the individual and the University.
Requests must be initiated by the faculty member, and the continuation
of benefits is not an entitlement; each case is to be reviewed on its
merits.

On approval of such requests, the Office of the Provost will arrange
with Human Resources for continuation of the faculty benefits stated
below for the faculty member for a leave without pay of up to one year,
with an additional one-year extension based on a written request
approved by the chairperson(s)/director(s), dean(s), and the Provost. In
exceptional cases, benefit eligibility may be continued for an
additional period.

**Possible Benefit Coverage**

Those benefits set forth below which are not provided by the applicable
source agency/institution (for which full-time Michigan State University
faculty appointed nine months or more are now eligible) may be provided
for faculty members for whom continued benefits eligibility is approved
by the Office of the Provost. (The benefits continued will be limited to
those in force for the individual immediately prior to leave of absence
without pay status);

1.  Health Care coverage with applicable University contribution;
2.  Dental plan coverage;
3.  Basic Employer Life;
4.  Long-Term Disability (LTD);
5.  Employee-paid life insurance if the employee continues to pay
    premium;
6.  Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage if the employee
    continues to pay premium.

::: {xmlns=""}
Salary-related benefits, e.g., University contributions to the 403(b)
Base Retirement Program, social security, etc., will not be provided
during a leave of absence without pay. Continued benefits which are
linked to an individual\'s salary status, e.g., expanded life insurance,
LTD, will be based on the applicable University salary rate immediately
prior to the leave of absence without pay.
:::

Requests for eligibility under this program should be directed to the
Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human
Resources after review and concurrence by the chairperson(s) and
dean(s)/separately reporting director(s).
