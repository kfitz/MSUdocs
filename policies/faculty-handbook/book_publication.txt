[Michigan State University
Press](http://msupress.msu.edu/index.html "University Press") is the
scholarly publishing arm of the university. Consonant with MSU\'s
land-grant mission and its stature as a member of the Association of
American Universities (AAU), the Press\'s primary function is to publish
the results of research and intellectual inquiry undertaken by scholars.

A manuscript, prospectus, or query letter may be sent to the Press for
consideration at any time. After an initial evaluation by the Press
editorial staff, works submitted for publication are subject to peer
review by scholars in the relevant field of specialty. In addition,
these works will undergo evaluation by the MSU Press Editorial Advisory
Board, after which the Press will make a determination of suitability
for publication.

MSU Press will market, sell, and otherwise make available its books to
scholars, libraries, and to members of the informed reading public. A
catalog of the Press\'s in-print, published works is available on
request.\
