**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR *(Cont.)***

::: {xmlns=""}
This office assists faculty in a number of ways:
:::

1.  It administers the Intramural Research Grants Program, which
    supports projects that are judged to be competitive for external
    funding or are otherwise expected to advance the scholarly
    enterprise of the university, and the Strategic Partnership Grants
    program, which provides larger grants for projects deemed to be
    strategically significant to the university.
2.  It provides support and oversight for major centers, analytical
    facilities, animal care facilities, safety and environmental
    services, and other functions that enhance research activities.
3.  Working with the Office of the Provost, it administers certain funds
    made available from the MSU Foundation to provide startup support
    for new faculty, matching for external grants, and seed monies for
    new projects that have the potential to attract funds from outside
    sponsors. (Faculty seeking matching funds are advised to initiate
    discussions first with their department chairperson and college
    dean.)
4.  It helps identify opportunities for external support of research and
    creative activities; manages participation in programs that limit
    the proposals an institution may submit; provides guidance and
    support for meeting requirements of the Michigan Life Sciences
    Corridor program; offers instruction on preparing and submitting
    proposals.
5.  It maintains a
    [website](http://www.msu.edu/unit/vprgs "VP for Research and Graduate studies")
    with information about conducting research at Michigan State and
    links to other sources of information about research activity.

Also part of the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate
Studies are the Office of Research Ethics and Standards, which promotes
the ethical conduct of research and assures compliance with federal,
state, and university laws and policies, and the Office of Intellectual
Property, which protects faculty inventions, represents the university
in licensing those inventions, manages MSU\'s portfolio of patents and
licenses, and administers patent policy.\
