**Faculty Review**

 Last updated: 3/3/2003

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on February 11,
1997 (to be  effective Fall semester 1997) and revised on March 3, 2003;
it reflects advice by the Faculty Council and the University Committee
on Faculty Affairs.*

All units must have procedures for written evaluation of tenure system
faculty at all ranks to support the annual merit process and to provide
a basis for a clear statement of performance expectations and
accomplishments. It is recognized that provisions and practices in units
may vary; however, all evaluation procedures must incorporate, at the
minimum, the principles included in this model policy for regular
faculty review, and must be applied uniformly to all faculty in the
unit.

**I. Principles**

While some variation may occur in the approach to reviews, the following
principles as implemented by unit procedures are to be followed by unit
administrators (i.e., Deans, Chairpersons and Directors) and faculty. In
the case of faculty with joint appointments, a lead unit administrator
shall be designated. The process should be clearly defined by the bylaws
or established personnel policies and procedures of each academic unit.

::: {xmlns=""}
-   Each tenure system faculty shall be evaluated on an annual basis and
    informed in writing of the results of his/her review by the unit
    administrator.
-   Each unit shall have clearly formulated and relevant written
    performance criteria and shall provide these at the time of
    appointment, and subsequently as necessary, to all faculty to
    clarify expectations.
-   Faculty shall be informed of all factors used for evaluation, the
    evaluation of their performance on each of these factors and the
    relationship between their performance and decisions on merit salary
    adjustments and, if appropriate, on reappointment, promotion and
    tenure. Faculty are entitled to have all their assigned duties given
    weight in the evaluation.
-   These annual assessments of faculty reviews shall be reflected in
    recommendations to the Provost\'s Office regarding reappointment,
    tenure, and promotion.

**II. Guidelines for Implementation**

-   Units should initiate the annual review process early enough so that
    the full process, including feedback to faculty, may be completed
    before the beginning of the fall semester.
-   Each faculty member shall submit a written summary of activities for
    the appropriate period of time to the unit administrator in a timely
    manner prior to the review. These materials will be shared with the
    faculty in accordance with unit bylaws and procedures.
-   If unit bylaws or procedures provide for performance evaluation by
    peer review committees, unit administrators shall rely on the advice
    of this designated group, in addition to their own judgment.
-   Unit administrators or their designees, no later than 3 months after
    completion of the evaluation, shall provide to the faculty member a
    written evaluation of her/his overall performance. Whenever
    appropriate, such evaluations shall contain constructive and
    explicit recommendations and clarify expectations of what is needed
    to make additional scholarly progress in the tenure system.
-   If, after receiving the written review, the faculty member disagrees
    with its content or chooses to provide additional documentation or
    comment, the faculty member shall have an opportunity to respond to
    the review. Any additional written faculty comment and/or
    documentation which is submitted within one month of receipt of the
    written review shall become part of the documentation for the
    review.
-   The full documentation for this written review, including the
    faculty member\'s response, shall be placed in the faculty member\'s
    unit personnel file.
-   Meetings between faculty members and unit administrators are
    encouraged prior to the written summary to provide feedback about
    expectations and evaluation. Each faculty member shall have the
    right to meet in person with the unit administrator or designee
    after the written review is received.
