**Academic Apparel**

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***
:::

Faculty members are expected to provide their own academic apparel for
use at commencement exercises and other ceremonies when such apparel is
appropriate. University funds may not be used to purchase academic
apparel for individual faculty.  However, on a limited basis, colleges
and departments may purchase (or rent) a small number of pre-made
University gowns for collective use.\
