**Adjunct and Clinical Appointments**

 Last updated: 7/1/1996

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was issued by the Office of the Provost in 1975
and was revised on July 1, 1996.*

These are appointments of persons whose primary responsibility and
income is outside the unit in which the appointment is made. Primary
responsibility or source of income may be in another unit of the
university or may be outside the university. The appointments are
usually without salary and for a maximum period of three years.
Reappointment is at the discretion of the administrative unit.
Successive reappointments do not confer tenure or other continuing
employment status.

Adjunct and clinical appointments may be made at any level from
instructor to professor and also are applicable to other titles such as
librarian, specialist, lecturer, etc. Persons holding such appointments
are expected to have the educational background and/or experience
required for the rank, and they must be interested in providing some
degree of service to the unit even though they are not available for a
regular appointment. Appointments are usually made on an \"adjunct\"
basis unless the appointee holds a professional medical degree, in which
case a \"clinical\" appointment is used.

The number of adjunct and/or clinical positions in each college will be
recommended by the dean and established by the Provost. Permission to
use the \"clinical\" title for individuals who do not hold a medical
degree may be requested of the Provost by units if this title is more
appropriate than the \"adjunct\" title in terms of the functions
performed. The proposal to use the \"clinical\" titles rather than the
\"adjunct\" titles must be made through regular administrative channels
prior to any offers to individual appointees.

Certain benefits and activities are extended to individuals appointed as
adjunct or clinical faculty members. Most of these privileges require an
MSU Identification Card. Further information and assistance can be
obtained from the appointing department.

1\. Areas in which the adjunct or clinical appointment carries faculty
status:

-   Library privileges^ 1^
-   Privilege of attending departmental, college and university faculty
    meetings
-   Use of intramural facilities and Forest Akers Golf Courses^ 1^
-   Purchase of athletic tickets at faculty rates^ 1^
-   MSU Identification Card
-   Eligibility for travel accident coverage when authorized to travel
    on University business
-   Eligibility for faculty membership in University Club
-   Parking privileges (may purchase standard permit or, for limited
    use, may purchase guest permit)^ 1^
-   MSU Net ID/email accounts
-   Professional liability insurance coverage while acting for the
    University in accordance with the requirements of University policy
    (see 5, below, applicable to clinical faculty in the Colleges of
    Human Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine.)
-   These appointments are \"covered\" by Unemployment Compensation;
    because little or no remuneration is involved, it is very unlikely
    that adjunct or clinical appointees would become eligible for
    compensation benefits.

2\. Areas in which the adjunct or clinical appointment does  **not**
 carry faculty status:

-   Any insurance benefit or program offered by the University other
    than those listed under (1) above
-   Tenure
-   Voting in University elections
-   Election to University committees

3\. Arrangements which are to be made on an individual basis at the unit
level:

-   Amount of time to be spent in the unit
-   Service on unit committees
-   Service on graduate committees
-   Voting at the unit level
-   Office space to be provided by the unit
-   Laboratory facilities to be provided
-   Secretarial help or graduate assistant help to be provided
-   Authority to teach, do research, or advise students for the unit
-   Authority to publish as a member of the unit
-   Authority to propose, receive and implement research grants

4\. Emeritus status for adjunct or clinical appointments

-   Individuals who meet the following criteria may be recommended for
    emeritus status:

a\. Be 62 years of age and have served as a clinical/adjunct faculty
member for fifteen years, or

b\. Have served as a clinical/adjunct faculty member for twenty-five
years at any age

Based on an appropriate record of contribution as a clinical/adjunct
faculty member, an individual may be recommended for emeritus status by
the appropriate chairperson/director and dean to the Office of the
Provost for final approval. The emeritus status is appended to the
highest clinical/adjunct rank achieved by the faculty member, e.g.,
associate adjunct professor emeritus.

Emeritus clinical/adjunct faculty are not designated as official
retirees of Michigan State University. Adjunct or clinical faculty
appointments with an emeritus designation are limited to the following
privileges:

-   Library privileges
-   Privilege of attending departmental, college, and University faculty
    meetings
-   Use of intramural facilities and Forest Akers Golf Courses
-   Purchase of athletic tickets at faculty rates
-   Eligibility for faculty membership in University Club
-   Parking privileges (may continue to purchase standard permit or
    guest permits)
-   MSU Net ID/email accounts

5\. Malpractice insurance coverage in teaching CHM and COM students ** **
^2^

The general principle of such coverage is that the University will
participate with the physician and his/her own attorney and malpractice
insurance carrier in the defense of a legal suit and be responsible for
the payment of any award that should be made against the physician, if
all the following conditions are met:

1.  The lawsuit is premised upon the negligence of an MSU student,
    including MSU residents and fellows, and the liability of the
    physician is derived from the student\'s negligence, i.e., is
    vicarious or secondary;
2.  The student\'s participation involved a level of delegated
    responsibility which could be reasonably expected of medical
    students at a similar level of training and experience at the time
    of his/her assignment;
3.  The negligence occurred during the course of an MSU-sponsored
    educational program in which the physician and/or patient was
    participating.

Such coverage is extended to all physicians involved in teaching MSU
students and trainees in an approved experience, not only those who are
members of the on-campus clinical faculty.

The University is generally not responsible for such coverage for
residents or fellows who are supported by individual hospitals or a
hospital-medical school educational corporation, nor does coverage
extend to instances where an MSU student, resident or fellow is
\"moonlighting.\" Professional liability coverage is provided by these
organizations. As is the case with all such coverage, it is important
that every incident involving an MSU student, resident, or fellow that
may potentially develop into a malpractice suit be brought to the
attention of the University as soon as possible and that the University
be notified within 5 days after the physician is notified that a suit
has been initiated. Notification should be sent to the Office of the
Dean, in writing, including all details that are known at the time. It
is essential that physicians cooperate fully with the University Office
of Legal Affairs and Office of Risk Management.

The contribution that clinical faculty make to teaching programs is
highly valued. MSU is committed to provide medical liability coverage
for participation in such educational activities and will continue to
assure such protection. The appropriate dean should be contacted for
questions or additional information.
