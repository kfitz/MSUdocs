**[]{#ADD}Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D)**
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
Eligibility\
Faculty/academic staff may select the AD&D Program within 60 days of
initial appointment to an eligible status. Coverage is provided if death
or dismemberment results from accidental cause. All faculty/academic
staff appointed 50% or greater for nine months or more are eligible to
participate.
:::

Coverage\
Coverage may be selected for the faculty/academic staff member and the
family, if desired, in one of the varying amounts as shown in the
brochure. Beneficiaries are designated by the individual and may be
changed at any time.

Cost\
Cost of the various coverages offered is described in the brochure
available in Human Resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
**[]{#Dental}Dental Plan** \
All faculty/academic staff appointed 50 percent time or more for nine
months or more and their eligible dependents may be covered by a dental
plan. The benefit can be retroactive to the appointment date if a new
employee enrolls within 60 days of the appointment. Failure to enroll
during the initial 60-day eligibility period will result in the
faculty/academic staff member having to wait until the next annual open
enrollment period. This coverage is available to official retirees and
their eligible dependents or survivors.
:::

Coverage\
Dental plan coverage is available through Delta Dental, a traditional
dental plan or Aetna, a dental maintenance organization (DMO).

The Delta Dental Plan covers fifty percent of the usual, customary, and
reasonable cost of preventive, diagnostic, restorative, prosthodontics
and orthodontic services. The plan provides an individual maximum of
\$600 per calendar year for covered charges. Orthodontic coverage is
limited to those under 19 years of age and is subject to an individual
lifetime maximum of \$600.

Aetna DMO utilizes primary care dentists to lower the cost - it is a
managed-care dental plan. Members select a primary care dentist (PCD)
from the provider network and visit their PCD as needed for treatment
and care. Highlights of the plan include:

\* Fixed co-pays for services\
\* No annual or lifetime benefit maximums\
\* No annual or lifetime deductibles\
\* Orthodontia is available for adults and children

Cost\
Premiums are fully paid by the University for full-time faculty/academic
staff for the Delta Dental Plan. There will be a premium deduction for
the Aetna DMO plan. There may be premium deduction for part-time
employees depending on the percent of employment and the number of
persons being covered.

**[]{#EPL}Employee-Paid Life** \
A faculty/academic staff member may select employee paid life within 60
days of initial appointment to an eligible status or by furnishing
evidence of insurability during Open Enrollment.
:::

Eligibility\
Faculty/academic staff appointed 50 percent time or more for nine months
or more are eligible to enroll for coverage.

Coverage\
The coverage is decreasing term insurance with no cash or loan value.
Coverage may be selected in varying amounts up to a \$2,000,000 maximum
depending on age and plan selected, as shown in the brochure.

Optional dependent coverage (for spouse or Other Eligible Individual and
children, if any) may also be selected.

Benefits are payable to the designated beneficiary in the event of death
while the plan is in force. Beneficiaries are designated by the
faculty/academic staff member and may be changed at any time.

Cost\
Costs vary according to the plan selected; rates are subject to future
group experience.

**[]{#HealthCare}Health Plan Coverage\
**If active faculty/academic staff members enroll in health plan
coverage within 60 days of initial appointment to an eligible status or
during an Open Enrollment, faculty/academic staff members and their
eligible dependents are covered for health care services. Coverage is
currently provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Community Blue
PPO, or Blue Care Network (BCN), or Consumer Driven Health Plan (CDHP).
In addition, a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Transition Plan is
available to those who have a mix of Medicare and non-Medicare eligible
family members. Enrollment can be retroactive to the appointment date if
a new employee enrolls within 60 days of the appointment. Specific
coverage details under these plans differ. In general, the following
apply:
:::

Eligibility\
A faculty/academic staff member appointed 50% time or more for nine
months or more may enroll themselves, their spouse or Other Eligible
Individual, and their eligible dependents. Failure to enroll during the
initial 60-day eligibility period will result in the faculty/academic
staff member having to wait until the next annual open enrollment
period.

Eligible spouses (or Other Eligible Individual) who are eligible to
enroll for health plan coverage through other employment must enroll in
that coverage if the annual premium cost to the spouse/Other
Eligible Individual is \$850 or less. MSU\'s health plan coverage then
becomes the secondary payer.

Coverage\
The health plans offered through the University provide coverage for
semi-private hospital room charges up to 365 days and additional
hospital expenses, including intensive care, recovery room, anesthetics,
etc.. Surgical benefits, diagnostic X-ray and lab tests are provided
whether performed in or out of the hospital. The plans provide coverage
for office calls subject to either a co-payment and/or satisfaction of
an annual deductible amount. Most other medically necessary
out-of-pocket expenses are also covered subject to a deductible and
co-payment. Both Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Community Blue
PPO, Blue Care Network (BCN) and the Consumer Driven Health
Plan offer in- and out-of-network coverage. Out-of-network services
require a higher out-of-pocket cost.

Prescription Drugs\
The prescription drug plan is a co-pay plan for generic and brand drugs
and is administered through CVS Caremark. CVS Caremark has a large
network of over 51,000 participating retail pharmacies, including some
of the largest drug store chains. Employees may choose to purchase their
prescriptions at a participating retail pharmacy, at an MSU pharmacy
(Olin Health Center or the MSU Clinical Center pharmacies) or through
CVS Caremark\'s mail order
program. [(Copays)](https://www.hr.msu.edu/benefits/prescription-drug-plan/caremark-copay.html "Caremark copays")

Cost\
MSU provides a monthly University contribution toward the premium for
health plan coverage for eligible faculty/academic staff. If an
additional premium is required, it will be deducted from the
faculty/academic staff member\'s paycheck. The University does not make
a contribution during periods when a faculty/academic staff member does
not receive a paycheck.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {xmlns=""}
**[]{#Waive Healthcare}Waiver of Health Plan Coverage\
**A faculty/academic staff member who is covered by another group health
plan is eligible to waive their MSU health care coverage and receive up
to a \$600 cash payment. (Retirees and faculty/academic staff whose
spouses or Other Eligible Individual are employed at MSU are not
eligible for the waiver option.) The normal waiver period is January 1
to December 31, with payment to be received the following February.
:::

The cash payment is considered taxable income.

If other coverage is involuntarily discontinued, the faculty/academic
staff member has 30 days to enroll in an MSU health care plan with the
waiver payment prorated.

Individuals newly hired, terminated, going on unpaid leave of absence,
or retiring will also receive a prorated payment.

Individuals accrue points based on their employment percent and the
number of months they are enrolled in the waiver: 1 point for each month
in waiver if full-time; .75 for 3/4-time or .5 if half-time. See chart
below.

  ------------------------ ---------------------
  **Points accrued**       **Waiver payments**
  Full 12 points           \$600
  9 through 11.75 points   \$450
  6 through 8.75 points    \$300
  3 through 5.75 points    \$150
  Less than 3 points       \$0
  ------------------------ ---------------------

Eligibility\
Faculty/academic staff appointed 50% time or more for nine months or
more are eligible to waive MSU\'s health plan coverage within 60 days of
appointment or during the annual open enrollment period. A completed
form is not required each year during open enrollment in order to
continue participation in the waiver.
