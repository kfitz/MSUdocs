:::

Michigan State University, as a land-grant institution, has long served
the citizens of Michigan in a variety of ways in addition to teaching
and research.

Today a substantial array of services is delivered to various publics
both on- and off-campus. Faculty/academic staff assignments often
include an expectation of this kind of service which may range from very
modest to full-time activity. Some of these services may generate
revenue for the University from fees charged to the public, as in the
case of health care services in the Colleges of Human, Osteopathic and
Veterinary Medicine.

In other cases, as with MSU Extension, the services are provided free to
the public through funding from the Michigan legislature, local, county
and municipal governments and the federal government. Faculty/academic
staff should ascertain under which type of funding they are expected to
deliver services and adhere closely to the procedures involved.
Faculty/academic staff are protected as representatives of the
University when delivering these formal University services, whether on-
or off-campus.\
