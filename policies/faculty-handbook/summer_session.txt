**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 26,
1991.*

Faculty members appointed on an academic year basis may be assigned
teaching, research or public service duties for the summer term in
addition to fall and spring terms. Summer instructional appointments
will normally be limited to the equivalent of one regular summer
session. Faculty members may also elect to pursue additional teaching,
research or service assignments up to a total maximum effort not to
exceed 3/9 of the previous academic year appointment. Regular summer
instructional appointments for a summer session, either Summer A or
Summer B, will be compensated at the rate of 2/9 (22.2%) of the previous
year\'s salary, with a maximum earning level of 3/9 of the previous
academic year\'s salary. (No benefit premiums or base retirement
contributions are made on this pay.) Faculty members appointed on an
academic year basis may perform summer duties involving teaching,
research and public service in exchange for one of the other semesters
providing:

    disadvantaged.
3.  A \"Non-Standard AY Duty Period Agreement\" is completed and signed
    in advance by the faculty member, chairperson, dean, and Provost.
4.  Requests to exchange summer term duties for an assignment during the
    regular academic year must be agreed reasonably in advance of the
    summer term in which exchange duties are to commence.
5.  Exchange duties may involve teaching, research, and public service
    responsibilities.
6.  Exchange duties may involve a period of one year or longer periods
    subject to a memorandum signed in advance by the faculty member,
