**Leave of Absence With Pay**

If the faculty/academic staff member\'s pay is being continued (e.g., if
the leave is a medical leave), the normal premiums will continue to be
deducted and the University will make its normal contribution toward the
cost of the health, dental, and retirement programs. Benefits are
continued in full for faculty members on sabbatical leave.\
