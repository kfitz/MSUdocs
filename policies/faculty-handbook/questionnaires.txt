**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**
:::

In order in insure consistency in the reporting of data to state and
federal agencies and to other colleges and universities, it is requested
that all questionnaires requiring data for the entire University be
referred to the [Office of Planning and Budgets
(OPB)](http://opbweb.opb.msu.edu/ "Office of Planning and Budgets").
This office will consider whether the data are readily available and
whether they should be released to the inquiring agent. Data requests or
questionnaires relating primarily to a subunit of the University may be
filled out by that subunit, but any items which require all University
data should be cleared with OPB. Although the office is not always in
possession of the necessary data, referral to the appropriate office or
person can be made, or in cases where justifiable, arrangements may be
made to collect the data.\
