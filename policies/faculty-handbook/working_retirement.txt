**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following advisory statement was issued by the Office of the
Provost on March 1, 1993 and revised on November 19, 1993.*

Michigan State University deeply appreciates the many years of loyal
service and creative contributions of its retired faculty and considers
them a continuing important resource for the institution. The university
encourages the use of their accumulated professional skills, as
appropriate, for the benefit of Michigan State as well as for retirees
themselves. Upon retirement, faculty discontinue their full-time roles,
but many may wish to provide their lifetimes of professional expertise
to the university in a variety of ways. Indeed, such relationships may
provide meaningful opportunities to phase into retirement while
continuing to assure university access to important human resources.

Service to Michigan State University may be in a variety of areas
including but not limited to:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   teaching courses and seminars and providing occasional lectures
-   research and outreach activities
-   administrative consultation and assistance
-   undergraduate and graduate advising, mentoring, and retention
    activities
-   internship development and supervision
-   admission/recruiting activities
-   alumni relations
-   academic governance input at various university levels
-   university, college, and unit committee assignments
-   development office activities

With the approval of the chairperson or director of the department or
school, an Emeritus faculty member in a working retirement appointment
may serve as one of the four required MSU regular faculty and may serve
as a chairperson or member of a doctoral student\'s guidance committee.

Participation in the MSU Retirees Association is another avenue through
which retired faculty can engage in meaningful opportunities and make
valuable contribution to the university.

The university views retired faculty, in addition to their specialized
disciplinary expertise, as an important continuing asset to this
institution. Emeritus faculty can and do contribute in a variety of
important ways at Michigan State University.

**Creative Working Retirement Options**

Deans, chairpersons, and directors are encouraged to actively explore,
with current as well as prospective emeritus faculty, opportunities for
creative working retirement options that are mutually beneficial and
agreeable. For active faculty who relinquish tenure at the time of
retirement, such arrangements will provide opportunities to continue to
make key contributions to the university while phasing into retirement.

Chairpersons, directors, lead deans, and other appropriate
administrators are responsible for negotiating specific appointment
possibilities involving the activities described above as well as
others, the nature of the appointment (full- or part-time), and the
length of the appointment commitment. Such post-retirement appointment
agreements can be for a fixed term or renewed on a mutually agreeable
basis.

Creative working retirement options can be on a volunteer or paid basis.
Salaries will be provided on a prorated basis based on the salary in
force at the time of the retirement and the percent of employment during
the post-retirement appointment period. When teaching responsibilities
are involved, the salary will be calculated in accordance with
university summer school teaching assignment policies. The assignment
agreement also may include provision of services and facilities to the
emeritus faculty member during the assignment period including but not
limited to:

::: {xmlns=""}
-   an office assignment
-   laboratory space
-   secretarial assistance
-   computing support

Emeritus faculty with creative working retirement assignments are
appointed professor emeritus (with or without pay), and are encouraged
to participate in collegiate and department/school academic governance.
Grant and contract acquisition is also encouraged with the same support
assistance available from the office of the Vice President for Research
and Graduate Studies as provided to currently appointed regular
faculty.\
\
In accordance with university policy, emeritus faculty with creative
working retirement assignments who return to active employment at 50%
time or more for nine months or longer are eligible to receive benefits
such as health, dental, employee paid life, travel accident, 403(b) Base
Retirement Program with University contribution, and 403(b) Supplemental
Retirement Program and/or 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan in the same
manner as an active employee. While the details of particular
assignments must be developed and agreed to with the administrator of
the appointing unit, the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President
for Academic Human Resources serves as a clearing house on options and
possibilities. Current emeritus faculty and active faculty contemplating
retirement who are interested in exploring creative working retirement
assignments should feel free to contact the Associate Provost and
Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources, Room 422
Administration Building, telephone number 353-5300.
