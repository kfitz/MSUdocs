**Disability & Veteran Self-Identification**

::: {xmlns=""}
**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**
:::

All applicants and hires to university positions are invited to
self-identify regarding veteran and disability status pre-offer and
post-offer, in accordance with federal record keeping requirements.  In
addition, every three years faculty and academic staff are invited to
self-identify regarding veteran and disability status by participating
in a university-wide survey.  Participation in the survey is voluntary
and allows all faculty and academic staff to update their veteran and/or
disability status. Under state and federal laws, qualified individuals
with a disability have the right to request and receive reasonable
accommodation.

Surveys are conducted by the Offices of Academic Human Resources and
Human Resources. The data is used to evaluate MSU\'s efforts in
providing equal access, promotional and equal employment opportunity to
individuals in these groups.\
