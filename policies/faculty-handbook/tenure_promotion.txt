**Promotion of Tenured Faculty**

 Last updated: 12/8/1997

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on December 8,
1997.*

Recommendations for the promotion of tenured faculty must be in accord
with the provisions of the tenure system and provide the same procedural
protections that are provided to non-tenured faculty as described in the
statement on \"Non-Tenured Faculty in the Tenure System.\" Specifically,
tenured faculty are entitled to confer with the unit review group that
is designated to make recommendations with respect to promotion before a
decision is made in their case and, upon the written request from a
tenured faculty member denied promotion, shall receive in writing from
the department chairperson/school director the reasons for this
decision.\
