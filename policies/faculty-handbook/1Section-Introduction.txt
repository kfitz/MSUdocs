Faculty Handbook - Introduction Section {#faculty-handbook---introduction-section xmlns=""}
=======================================

Foreword {#foreword xmlns=""}
--------

The Faculty Handbook provides information to help you as a
faculty/academic staff member of Michigan State University. You will
find most of the policies, regulations and procedures of the University
either contained here in their entirety or referenced. Those which are
not totally included because of their length or because they are
peripheral to the faculty/academic staff mission can be found in other
University publications. The following documents are general sources of
information that may be of use to faculty and academic staff:

1.  The Faculty Handbook contains employment policies for faculty and
    academic staff. It is available from your department secretary, or
    Academic Human Resources, 355-1526.
2.  The [Bylaws for Academic
    Governance](https://www.msu.edu/unit/acadgov/ "Bylaws Academic Governance")
    are available from your department secretary, or the Office of the
    Secretary for Academic Governance, 355-2337.
3.  The [Academic
    Programs](http://www.reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ "Academic Programs")
    section of the University catalog contains: description of academic
    programs, mission statement, President\'s statement, honorary and
    professional organizations, etc. and is available from your
    department secretary, or from Room 50 Administration Building,
    353-0720.
4.  The Board of Trustees Policy Manual contains all policies approved
    by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University. It is
    available from the Office of the Secretary of the Board of Trustees,
    353-4647, or in college offices.
5.  [The Bylaws of the Board of
    Trustees](http://trustees.msu.edu/bylaws.html "Board of Trustees Bylaws")
    are available from the Office of the Secretary of the Board of
    Trustees, 353-4647.
6.  [Ordinances](http://trustees.msu.edu/ordinances.html "MSU Ordinances")
    of Michigan State University are available for viewing at the
    Department of Police and Public Safety, 355-1830; or at the
    Reference Desk in the main Library.
7.  [Spartan Life](http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/ "Spartan Life"),
    the student handbook and resource guide contains: student
    legislative and judicial procedure, Academic Freedom for Students at
    MSU, Graduate Student Rights and Responsibilities, student
    regulations, etc. and is available from Student Affairs and
    Services, 355-8286.
8.  The [Manual of Business
    Procedures](http://ctlr.msu.edu/COMBP/Default.aspx "Manual of Business Practices (Controller's office)")
    contains information regarding proper University business
    procedures. It is available from your department secretary.

Wherever possible, dates of adoption and sources have been included for
University policies and regulations. For policies approved by the Board
of Trustees, the original approval date and the date of the most recent
amendment is provided. Dates of other actions by the Board on a
particular policy may be found in the Board of Trustees\' Policy Manual
which is available in all college offices or from the Office of the
Secretary of the Board of Trustees.

The Faculty Handbook is generally updated on an annual basis. It is the
responsibility of the department chairperson/school director to maintain
an updated copy to which faculty/academic staff may refer.

The responsibility for distributing information about changes rests with
the Office of the Provost. Questions regarding content should first be
addressed to your departmental chairperson or the director of your
school.
