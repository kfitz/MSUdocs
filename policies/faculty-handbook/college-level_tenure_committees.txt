**College-Level Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Committees**

 Last updated: 1/26/2005

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*This policy statement was issued by the Office of the Provost on
January 26, 2005, to be effective with the 2005-06 academic year.*

**University Policy**

Each departmentally organized college is required to establish a
college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committee that is
charged to provide advice to the dean about department/school
recommendations for reappointment, promotion and tenure.  The
reappointment, promotion and tenure process is a critical component in
enhancing academic excellence and building a progressively stronger
faculty - faculty who meet continuously higher standards to assure
enhanced quality within a national and international context. 
Establishment of college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure
committees is in accordance with Section 2.1.2.2.of the *Bylaws for
Academic Governance* that states \"deans are responsible for
educational, research, and service programs of the respective college or
separately reporting unit. This responsibility includes budgetary
matters, physical facilities, and personnel matters in his or her
jurisdiction taking into account the advisory procedures of the
college.\"  College-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committees
will enhance the dean\'s ability to make reappointment, promotion and
tenure recommendations that improve academic unit quality.

It is recognized that practices and procedures in colleges may vary;
however, all college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure
committees must incorporate, at a minimum, the principles included
below.

**Principles**

Each departmentally organized college must include in its written
materials governing the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process a
procedure for establishing a college-level reappointment, promotion and
tenure review committee, including methods for selecting committee
members and how the committee will function.  At a minimum, the
following principles should be clearly defined by the bylaws or
established polices and procedures of each college.

    members holding fixed term or Health Programs appointments.
2.  Committee members may be selected through an election and/or
    appointment process.

    department/school standards, criteria and procedures for
    reappointment, promotion and tenure, and other matters as requested
    by the dean.
