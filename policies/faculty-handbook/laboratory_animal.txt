[University Laboratory Animal Resources
(ULAR)](http://www.ular.msu.edu/ "University Laboratory Animal Resources"),
which reports to the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies,
provides a comprehensive program of animal care for all laboratory
animal colonies, as well as training for researchers. ULAR also
participates in developing institutional policies designed to insure
humane treatment of animals and to assist investigators in maintaining
high quality care of animals used in MSU projects.

Additional information regarding both general principles and specific
issues that apply to the care and use of animals at Michigan State
University is available through ULAR and the IACUC.\
