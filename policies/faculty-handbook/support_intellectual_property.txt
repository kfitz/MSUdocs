A limited amount of funding is available through the [Office of
Intellectual
Property](http://www.technologies.msu.edu/ "Office for Intellectual Property") to
support innovative projects that have the potential to generate patents
and royalty income. For example, funds might be provided to purchase an
instrument that would facilitate additional studies to bring an idea to
a patentable stage. For more information, contact the Director of the
Office of Intellectual Property, in the Office of the Vice President for
Research and Graduate Studies.\
