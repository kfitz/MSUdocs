**Coursepacks**

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

The Code of Teaching Responsibility requires the provision of materials
such as syllabi and study guides to the students. Similarly, scantron
exam sheets are provided free of charge by the Scoring Office and should
also not be included in coursepacks. These items are covered through the
tuition that students pay for their courses.\
