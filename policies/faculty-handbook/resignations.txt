**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***
:::

The procedures under Michigan State University\'s tenure system bind the
University to give adequate notice to faculty members if they are not to
be reappointed. To protect the University in its efforts to find
satisfactory replacements, it is expected that faculty members planning
to resign will in every case give at least ninety days notice in writing
to the department chairperson/school director or dean.

Faculty members leaving the University should contact Human Resources,
110 Nisbet Building, for information concerning termination,
continuation or conversion of their benefit programs.\
