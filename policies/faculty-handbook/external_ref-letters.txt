External letters of reference are required for all reviews of tenure
system faculty involving the granting of tenure or promotion; they are
not required for reappointments. External letters of reference are
required in order to ensure that individuals recommended have an
achievement and performance level that is comparable with faculties of
peer institutions. It is recognized that practices and procedures in
units may vary; however, the process of soliciting external letters of
reference must incorporate the following principles and procedures,
which must be applied uniformly to all faculty in the unit. Any
exception to these principles must be approved by the Office of the
Provost prior to implementation.

1.  External letters of reference should be from leading scholars in the
    relevant discipline at peer institutions. As a general rule, an
    external reviewer must at least hold the academic rank for which the
    candidate is being considered, i.e. an associate professor cannot
    review one being considered for professor. While there can be no
    definitive list of peer institutions, research-intensive
    universities of international scope such as the CIC^1^ institutions
    normally constitute our peers. It is incumbent on candidates and
    administrators to provide an explanation when external reviewers are
    selected from institutions that are not of the same stature as CIC
    institutions.
2.  External letters of reference should be submitted on institutional
    letterhead and carry the evaluator signature.
3.  All external letters of reference solicited and received must be
    included in the review materials. Unsolicited letters will not be
    included in the review materials.
4.  If an external letter of reference is solicited and the referee
    fails to or declines to submit a letter of evaluation, this
    information shall become part of the candidate\'s review materials.
    If a reason is provided in writing, it shall become part of the
    candidate\'s review materials unless precluded by an agreement on
    confidentiality.
5.  College/department/school procedures will specify the minimum number
    of external letters (with a recommended minimum of four and maximum
    of six).
6.  The department chairperson/school director/dean of a
    non-departmentally organized college shall form a list of external
    referees. Department/school/non-departmentally organized college
    procedures will specify the number of potential evaluators to be
    suggested by the candidate, to which the department
    chairperson/school director/dean of a non-departmentally organized
    college (and others as provided by department/school/ college
    procedures) will add names. In accordance with
    college/department/school procedures, the chairperson/director/dean
    will determine which of the potential external referees will be
    asked to provide letters of reference. College/department/school
    procedures will specify a proportion or number of external letters
    of reference to be solicited from persons suggested by the
    candidate.
7.  Candidates must not discuss their case with prospective or actual
    external evaluators at any stage of the review process, except as
    provided by department/school/college procedures. Soliciting
    external letters of reference and providing materials to the
    referees is solely the responsibility of the department
    chairperson/school director/dean of a non-departmentally organized
    college.
8.  External referees must be professionally capable to evaluate the
    candidate\'s scholarly work objectively and to comment on its
    significance in the discipline. Letters must predominantly represent
    persons other than collaborators and in no case may those who served
    as primary dissertation chair or major advisor for post doctoral
    research be chosen as external referees.  
9.  College/department/school procedures will specify the materials sent
    to external referees. It is minimally required, however, that in
    addition to the C.V. and reflective essay, a representative sample
    of the candidate\'s scholarly work will be made available to the
    external reviewer for the review.
10. The unit administrator\'s request to an external referee must
    include:
    1.  the unit\'s statement on confidentiality, which must be
        consistent with the University\'s statement as contained in the
        policy \"Confidentiality of Letters of Reference for
        Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Recommendations\"
    2.  a request to disclose any potential conflicts of interest
    3.  a description of the candidate\'s assignment, including, for
        example, the percentage of the appointment devoted to
        research/creative activities, teaching, service, etc.^2^
    4.  a request to assess:
        1.  the candidate in comparison to others in her/his cohort
            nationally, and
        2.  the extent and quality of the scholarship of the candidate,
            including its contribution to the discipline.
11. For each external referee, the unit administrator shall provide:
    1.  Name, rank/title, institutional affiliation.
    2.  Brief summary of the referee\'s qualifications or CV
    3.  Name of the person who recommended the evaluator, e.g.,
        candidate, chairperson/director/dean, or other (specified).
    4.  An assessment of the evaluator relationship to the candidate,
        including potential conflicts of interest.
