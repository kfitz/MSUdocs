may receive credit for past service if the following conditions are met:

1.  Faculty/academic staff who terminate employment from Michigan State
    University for more than twelve (12) months and subsequently are
    re-employed by MSU for five (5) or more continuous years at
    half-time or more are eligible to apply for credit for the previous
    employment.
2.  A minimum of one year of service prior to the date of termination is
    required to apply for credit for past service.
3.  Approved leaves of absence or sabbatical leaves do not constitute a
    break in service.

programs. To apply for credit for past service, faculty/academic staff
must submit a written request to MSU Human Resources, 110 Nisbet, after
establishing five years of continuous re-employment.
