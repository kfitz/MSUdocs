**Procedure for Empaneling a Hearing Committee**

1.  The Chair of the UCFT, in consultation with the Office of the
    Provost, shall annually establish a three-person standing Hearing
    Committee.  The members of the Hearing Committee will serve until
    their replacements are selected the following academic year.  A list
    of three alternates will also be maintained in the event that a
    panel member is unavailable.  The Office of the Provost will arrange
    training about academic personnel policies and the dismissal for
    cause process for the review panel and alternates. 
2.  Members of the Hearing Committee shall be tenured full professors
    who are currently serving as UCFT members or who have served on the
    UCFT within the last five academic years.  Three alternates will
    also be selected in the event a conflict of interest or other
    exceptional circumstance precludes a member of the Hearing Committee
    from serving.
3.  No member of a Hearing Committee may serve on a hearing involving a
    faculty member from the same college in which the hearing member is
    appointed.
4.  During the meeting referenced in Section VII.B.2.a of the Policy,
    either party may challenge a member of the Hearing Committee on the
    grounds that the member has a conflict of interest.  The standard
    the Chair of the UCFT shall follow in ruling on the challenge is
    whether, in light of the challenged person's knowledge of the case
    or personal or professional relationships with a party, the
    challenged person would be and be seen to be able to fairly and
    impartially hear the case and render a fair and impartial judgment.
    The Chair of the UCFT shall rule on any challenges.
5.  After the selection of the Hearing Committee, the Hearing Committee
    shall elect its Chair from its membership. The Hearing Committee
    Chair shall be in charge of the hearing process from this point
    until the Hearing Committee has submitted its report and
    recommendations.
6.  The University shall provide legal counsel for the Chair of the UCFT
    and for the Hearing Committee.

Procedure for the Hearing**

The Chair of the Hearing Committee shall be in charge of the hearing. 

1.  Legal counsel for the Hearing Committee may be present at all
    hearings and deliberations.
2.  Hearing sessions may be scheduled, at the discretion of the Chair,
    on any weekday; weekends during the hours 8:00 a.m.--10:00 p.m.; or,
    by unanimous consent of the parties and Hearing Committee members,
    on University holidays.  Reasonable efforts shall be made to
    accommodate the scheduling requests of the parties and Hearing
    Committee members.
3.  The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner to the greatest
    extent possible.  Formal rules of evidence do not apply.
4.  The Chair of the Hearing Committee may, in his/her discretion,
    exclude evidence, including witness testimony, if the Chair
    determines that such evidence is not relevant to the charges at
    issue.
5.  The Chair of the Hearing Committee shall read the charges against
    the faculty member.
6.  The Chair of the Hearing Committee shall request an initial
    statement summarizing the faculty member's responses, which may be
    presented by the faculty member or his/her advisor or legal counsel.
7.  The charging party (or his/her representative, advisor, or legal
    counsel) shall present documents/testimony to support the charges.
    The faculty member and his/her advisor or legal counsel have the
    right to cross-examine all witnesses. The Hearing Committee will
    normally withhold questions until the cross-examination of the
    witness has been completed.
8.  The faculty member (or his/her representative, advisor, or legal
    counsel) shall present documents/testimony to refute the charges.
    The charging party and his/her legal counsel have the right to
    cross-examine witnesses. The Hearing Committee will normally
    withhold questions until the cross-examination of the witness has
    been completed.
9.  After the faculty member's witnesses have completed their testimony,
    including any cross-examination, the charging party may present
    rebuttal evidence. Rebuttal evidence shall be limited to new matters
    introduced in the faculty member's case. Surrebuttal evidence
    (limited to evidence rebutting the charging party's rebuttal
    evidence) shall also be allowed.
10. The charging party (or his/her representative, advisor, or legal
    counsel) shall present his/her closing argument.

    counsel) shall present his/her closing argument.

Procedures for Selecting Dismissal for Cause Review Officer**

1.   A panel of ten tenured faculty members shall be established from
    which one shall be selected by the Provost of the University to
    advise the Provost when a Dean proposes to initiate dismissal for
    cause proceedings against a faculty member under Section I of the
    Policy. The reviewer, called the Dismissal for Cause Review Officer,
    or the Review Officer, may not be from the same college as the
    faculty member against whom charges may be filed or the Dean filing
    the charges.
2.  The panel shall be composed of tenured faculty members selected by
    the Provost in consultation with the Chairs of the UCFT and
    University Committee on Faculty Affairs.  It is preferable for panel
    members to be tenured full professors who have (a) experience in
    chairing grievance panels, standing or ad hoc committees, (b)
    training or experience in grievances, arbitration, and/or mediation,
    or (c) legal training.
3.  Panel members shall serve at the pleasure of the Provost, with
    vacancies filled in accordance with the procedure stated above.
