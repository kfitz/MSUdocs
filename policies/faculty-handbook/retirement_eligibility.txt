**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on February
17, 1962 and revised on December 6, 1991.*

**Eligibility Policy**

The University retirement plan is described in the section entitled
Faculty/Academic Staff Benefit and Retirement Programs. Michigan State
University\'s faculty/academic staff retirement policy provides:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Retirement of faculty/academic staff members is optional on the
    first day of the term following attainment of age 62 with 15 years
    of service or after 25 years of service at any age. **^1^**  For
    more detail, please see the [Retiring from the University
    Policy](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retirement.html "Retiring from the University").
    **^ ^**
2.  Tenure system faculty members appointed prior to January 1, 1992 who
    meet the retirement eligibility requirements in 1, above, may serve
    their final year before retirement on a terminal consultantship
    basis with agreed upon duties involving at least a half-time
    assignment provided there were no compensated leaves in the five
    years immediately prior to retirement. Recommendation for such
    consultantship must be made by the department chairperson/school
    director and dean. The salary must be provided by the
    department/school. In applying for a terminal year consultantship,
    the faculty member must attach a letter to the retirement form
    outlining the proposed duties during the consultantship. At the end
    of the consultantship period, a report on the accomplishments is to
    be submitted to the department chairperson/school director or dean
    of a non-departmentally organized college. The retirement form is
    available in the [EBS
    Portal](https://secportal.ebsp.msu.edu/ "EBS portal ") (login
    required).
3.  A retired faculty/academic staff member may be re-employed, usually
    for part-time service, on a semester-to-semester or year-to-year
    basis. Salary will be determined at the time of appointment for such
    service. Retired faculty/academic staff who return to active
    employment at 50% time or more for nine months or longer are
    eligible to receive benefits such as health, dental, employee paid
    life, travel accident, 403(b) Base Retirement Program with
    University contribution, and 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program
    and/or 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan, in the same manner as an
    active employee.
