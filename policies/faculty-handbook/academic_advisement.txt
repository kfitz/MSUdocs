**Academic Advisement, Enrollment, Registration and Counseling**

 Last updated: 2/8/1966

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

*On January 20, 1966, the Educational Policies Committee distributed a
statement entitled \"Policy Recommendations on Academic Advising\". It
included the following definitions:*

**Academic Advisement** - Academic advisement is a continuing process in
which a student and a faculty member discuss possible options; first, in
the student\'s total educational program; second, in specific curricular
fields; and third, in potential careers, in order that the student may
make more intelligent choices.

**Enrollment** - Enrollment is a student responsibility in selecting
courses for a semester schedule from the student\'s Academic Progress
Plan previously developed but continually reviewed with the academic
adviser.

**Registration** - Registration is the process of securing classes for
which one has enrolled by payment of charges due. Completion of this
process generates official University and class records for use by
faculty and staff.

**Counseling** - Counseling is a service available from the [Counseling
Center](http://counseling.msu.edu/ "Counseling Center") to help students
adjust to social and personal problems encountered while enrolled in the
University, and to identify potential occupational choices.

*Several policy recommendations were approved by the Academic Council on
February 8, 1966, among them:*

Each department shall develop a system of advisement of students within
the context of the structure of the college and/or department consistent
with the following:

1.  Academic advising is a responsibility of faculty, but the division
    of responsibility (for example, relative emphasis on graduate versus
    undergraduate advising, number of advisees per faculty member, etc.)
    should be determined through mutual agreement between faculty and
    deans and/or department chairpersons in each college and/or
    department.
2.  Excellence and effort in advising are to be recognized by
    chairpersons and deans, as well as by the provost, as an integral
    part of a faculty member\'s assignment.
3.  Procedural provisions are to be made at the departmental and college
    level for the availability of academic advisors at times in addition
    to those scheduled for enrollment and registration.
4.  Students are responsible for studying and knowing University,
    college, and department requirements as stated in the catalog. They
    shall also prepare tentative academic plans for review by their
    academic advisers.
5.  With efficient use of faculty and student time as prime
    considerations, all administrative offices involved in enrollment
    and registration should continue to develop improvements in the
    process.

Procedures developed by the colleges for guidance of faculty involved in
student advising are available in college offices.

The *Academic Programs* section of the MSU Catalog contains definitive
information regarding academic advisement, enrollment, registration and
counseling in the pages titled \"[Undergraduate
Education](https://www.msu.edu/~uud/advising.html "Undergraduate advising").\"\
