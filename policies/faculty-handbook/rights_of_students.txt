*The Academic Council on May 12, 1970 approved a resolution which
reaffirmed the Code of Teaching Responsibilities and the provisions of
the report, \"Academic Freedom for Students at Michigan State
University.\" It reaffirmed:*

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The right of faculty members to conduct classes, and of students to
    participate in those classes, without interference or disruption.
2.  The right of every student to a satisfactory fulfillment of the
    contract entered into at the beginning of the term.
3.  The right of faculty members to dissent without jeopardizing their
    livelihood, and the right of students to dissent without
    jeopardizing their degree.
4.  Freedom of conscience for all members of the academic community.
5.  The Academic Council also requests its Educational Policies
    Committee (now University Committee on Academic Policy) to recommend
    policies regarding grades for students who absent themselves from
    classes in order to exercise the right to dissent.
6.  If, as a result of death, illness, leave of absence, consultation or
    any other reason, an instructor is unable to provide for students
    the instruction for which they enrolled, it is the responsibility of
    the department, together with the college and the University, to
    provide every student with the \"satisfactory fulfillment of the
    contract entered into at the beginning of the term.\"
