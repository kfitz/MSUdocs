**Participation in Commencement**

**V. INSTRUCTION *(Cont.)***

Commencement ceremonies are held at the end of Fall and Spring
semesters.

Department/School chairpersons and major professors or faculty advisors
who have students who are advanced degree candidates are requested to
participate in the graduate commencement ceremony.

Three hundred members of the faculty are expected to participate in the
baccalaureate degree ceremonies. The Commencement Committee, using the
distribution of Academic Senate members as a guide, prepares and
distributes college, department and school quotas to meet the required
number. Deans, chairpersons, and directors are responsible for meeting
these quotas. Each college establishes its own expectations for faculty
participation in the decentralized baccalaureate ceremonies at the end
of Spring semester.\
