**Promotion of Fixed Term Faculty**

 Last updated: 1/24/2013

 **IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES\
**\
*This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on January 24, 2013
(to be effective fall semester 2013). It reflects advice by the
University Committee on Faculty Affairs and the Faculty Senate.*

### Policy Statement {#policy-statement xmlns=""}

Each department, school and college regularly employing fixed term
faculty must have evaluation and review procedures for the promotion of
fixed term faculty.^\[1\]^ It is recognized that provisions and
practices in units may vary; however, all procedures must incorporate,
at a minimum, the principles included in this policy and must be applied
consistently to similarly situated fixed term faculty.

### Principles {#principles xmlns=""}

1.  While the mix of duties performed by fixed term faculty may vary
    within and across units, academic rank at Michigan State University
    must be based on standards that result in a progressively stronger
    faculty. A fixed term faculty member\'s level of accomplishment,
    even if limited to a narrow range of duties (e.g. only teaching),
    should reflect the same level of accomplishment for that set of
    duties as is required for a tenure system faculty member being
    promoted to the same rank.
2.  Procedures adopted must minimally include:
    1.  Review and recommendation by a faculty review committee at the
        unit and college levels that make recommendations to the
        chairperson/director and dean.
    2.  Provide an opportunity for the fixed term faculty member to
        confer with the faculty review committee before a recommendation
        is made.
    3.  Each chairperson, director, and dean must make a recommendation
        taking into consideration faculty evaluations and other
        supporting information, yet unit administrators are responsible
        as individuals for the recommendations made.
    4.  Candidates for promotion will be asked to provide materials for
        the review, using the \"Recommendation for Reappointment,
        Promotion or Tenure Action form, (Form D), as a guide, but must
        include:
        1.  Current curriculum vita,
        2.  Reflective essay about accomplishments over the reporting
            period (5 page maximum),
        3.  A representative sample of scholarly work, and
        4.  Evidence of excellence in performing assigned duties, e.g.
            significance, impact, and innovation of research/creative
            activities, instructional activities, and service.
    5.  Because of the diversity in assignments of fixed term faculty,
        unit administrators must prepare a description of the
        candidate\'s assignment, including, for example, the percentage
        of the appointment devoted to research/creative activities,
        teaching, service, etc.
3.  External review letters may be used, to the extent relevant,
    following the principles in the policy, \"[External Letters of
    Reference](https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/faculty-handbook/external_ref-letters.html "External letters of reference").\"

With the exception of the sample of scholarly work, all materials, along
with the recommendations of the department chairperson/school director
and dean, must accompany each promotion recommendation for Provost
Office review.

^\[1\]^ The policy must address promotions from the rank of assistant
professor to associate professor and from associate professor to
professor. It does not apply to promotions from the rank of instructor
to assistant professor.\
