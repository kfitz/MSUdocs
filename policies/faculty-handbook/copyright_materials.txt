**Development of Copyrighted Materials**

 Last updated: 5/6/2005

**VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR (*Cont.*)**

::: {xmlns=""}
*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on June 22,
2001 and revised on May 6, 2005; it replaces the statement on
Development of Instructional Materials approved by the Board of Trustees
on November 16, 1973.*
:::

**Introductory Concepts**

\"Circular 1: Copyright Basics\", issued by the United States Copyright
Office in the Library of Congress^1 ^, begins with the following
definition:

::: {xmlns=""}
> *\"Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the
> United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of \"original works
> of authorship,\" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and
> certain other intellectual works. This protection is available to both
> published and unpublished works. Section 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act
> generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to do and
> to authorize others to do the following:*
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
> *+ To reproduce the work in copies or ;*

> *+ To prepare derivative works based upon the work;*

> *+ To distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by
> sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;*

> *+ To perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
> dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and
> other audiovisual works;*

> *+ To display the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical,
> dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic,
> or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion
> picture or other audiovisual work; and*

> *+ In the case of sound recordings, to perform the work publicly by
> means of a digital audio transmission.*
:::

::: {xmlns=""}
> *In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the rights
> of attribution and integrity as described in section 106A of the 1976
> Copyright Act.\"*

**Among its several other provisions, Circular 1 states:**

> *\"Copyright protects \'\'original works of authorship\'\' that are
> fixed in a tangible form of expression.\"*

> *\"Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in
> fixed form. The copyright in the work of authorship immediately
> becomes the property of the author who created the work. Only the
> author or those deriving their rights through the author can
> rightfully claim copyright. In the case of works made for hire, the
> employer and not the employee is considered to be the author. Section
> 101 of the copyright law defines a \"work made for hire\" as: (1) a
> work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
> employment; or (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as
> a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or
> other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as
> a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material
> for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a
> written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a
> work made for hire\...\... The authors of a joint work are co-owners
> of the copyright in the work, unless there is an agreement to the
> contrary.\"*

and

> *\"Copyright in each separate contribution to a periodical or other
> collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a
> whole and vests initially with the author of the contribution.\"*

**Section I \-- Ownership Principles**
:::

MSU follows standard academic practice in disclaiming ownership of, and
royalties proceeding from, traditional academic works (books, essays,
works of art, musical compositions and recordings, and the like), unless
one or more \"Special Circumstances\" exist.  The Special Circumstances
that cause the University to retain copyright ownership are set forth in
Section II, below. Works for which Special Circumstances exist and of
which the University retains ownership are called \"University-owned\"
works in this Policy.

It is also the tradition at Michigan State University and its peer
institutions for eligible \"University Authors\" to share in third-party
licensing revenue received by the University in those cases where
Special Circumstances cause the University to retain copyright
ownership. Eligible University Authors are identified in Section III.

Students who author or create copyrighted works which are submitted to
meet course requirements own the copyrights in such works, even if they
have been created using University facilities. Neither the course
instructor nor the University may utilize or distribute student-owned
copyrighted works for purposes beyond those of the course in which they
are submitted without obtaining the written permission of the student.
Students also own the copyrights in their theses and dissertations.

**Section II \-- Special Circumstances in which the University Retains
Copyright Ownership**

The University retains the ownership of copyrighted works created by one
or more of its employees within the scope of their employment whenever
at least one of the following Special Circumstances applies:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Creation of the work involved substantial^2 ^use without charge of
    equipment, materials, or staff services of any of the various units
    of the University;
2.  Creation of the work was supported with money, released time^3 ^, or
    other substantial^2 ^resources from any unit of the University;
3.  Creation of the work was directly commissioned^4 ^by the University
    or one of its units, where the employee(s) who created the work did
    so using some part of the time for which compensation was received
    from any University budget, including any grant or contract budget
    administered by the University or any budget based on special
    legislative appropriations; or
4.  Creation of the work occurs in University-approved faculty outside
    work for pay, if in the opinion of the administrators approving such
    outside work for pay the work predictably competes with University
    functions or products that are, or reasonably might be, developed
    and offered by the University in the furtherance of its mission.

In some cases, University units may wish to provide substantial support
for the creation of copyrightable works without such support
constituting a Special Circumstance. (For example, manuscript completion
subventions are common in certain disciplines.) In such event, the unit
should contact the Office of the Provost prior to providing the support.
The Office of the Provost shall have discretion to grant a waiver in
appropriate cases, after obtaining the agreement of all units providing
support for the work in question.
:::

Payment of salary to an individual on sabbatical shall not be construed
as support for the creation of a specific work, and hence shall not by
itself constitute a Special Circumstance.

Any person who has a question as to whether the creation of a particular
work falls within the scope of employment and/or qualifies under one or
more of the Special Circumstances should initiate an inquiry with the
Office of the Provost as soon as possible after the question arises.

**Section III \-- University Authors of Works Owned by MSU**

For the purposes of this Policy, a University Author of a work is anyone
of the following who, in the scope of his/her employment at the
University, authors or creates, either alone or in collaboration with
others, a University-owned work:

::: {xmlns=""}
a.  faculty member,
b.  specialist,
c.  librarian,
d.  executive manager,
e.  postdoctoral research fellow,
f.  research associate appointed through the academic personnel system,
g.  MSU Extension or Experiment Station field staff member,
h.  FRIB/NSCL continuing appointment system staff member,
i.  graduate or graduate professional student conducting academic
    research or creative activity, or
j.  undergraduate student conducting academic research or creative
    activity.

Any member of the University community who contributes to the creation
of a University-owned work may be treated as a University Author with
respect to that work upon the written agreement of all authors or
creators of that work who are themselves University Authors.
:::

In addition, the Office of the Provost shall have discretion to enter
into agreements whereby University Author status is granted to and
accepted by other individuals who hold a copyright interest in a given
work and who assign such interest to the University.

If for a given University-owned work there exists no living or dead
University Author, then the provisions of this Policy regarding
University Authors are inapplicable to that work.

**Section IV \-- External Constraints on Copyright Ownership**

Copyrighted works created by University employees and produced under
grants to the University from the federal government or other extramural
funding sources, or produced under contracts between the University and
third parties, shall be subject to the contract or grant with respect to
copyright ownership, distribution and use, and other rights.

**Section V \-- Internal Use of University-Owned Works**

Each use of a University-owned work by any unit of the University shall
be subject to the following conditions:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Use internal to the University requires approval of the
    unit^5 ^primarily responsible for the creation of the
    University-owned work. Such approval will be deemed implicit when
    the sponsoring unit^5^ agrees to storage and distribution by the
    University and if the sponsoring unit schedules courses and assigns
    instructional duties to which the University-owned instructional
    work is relevant.
2.  As long as a faculty member who is a University Author of
    University-owned material that was not directly commissioned by the
    University remains a member of the faculty of the University,
    his/her approval shall be required for internal use of the
    University-owned work, and his/her contribution should be explicitly
    acknowledged by the University user.
3.  To ensure the viability of long-term programs dependent upon
    University-owned works directly commissioned by the University,
    units of the University may use such directly commissioned works on
    a continuing basis, with or without the approval or further
    involvement of their University Authors. The contribution of
    University Authors should be explicitly acknowledged by the
    University user. A University Author of such work may petition the
    Office of the Provost that it be withdrawn for good cause (e.g., if
    the work contains serious errors or deficiencies in content or
    pedagogy that are not being resolved through amendment). The Office
    of the Provost may seek peer evaluations of the work in question, to
    assist it in assessing such withdrawal requests.
4.  When a University Author is no longer an employee of the University,
    the University may make internal use of the University-owned works
    he or she created without his/her approval or further involvement. A
    University Author no longer employed by the University may petition
    the Office of the Provost that such work be withdrawn for good cause
    (e.g., if the work contains serious errors or deficiencies in
    content or pedagogy that are not being resolved through amendment).
    The Office of the Provost may seek peer evaluations of the work in
    question, to assist it in assessing such withdrawal requests.

**Section VI \-- External Use and Publication**

1.  Subject to the provisions of this Policy, the University may, at its
    discretion, assign, transfer, lease, or sell all or part of its
    legal rights in a University-owned work, or place such work in the
    public domain. Where academically appropriate and feasible, the
    University may obtain other forms of legal protection for such
    University-owned works in the name of the University.
2.  University Authors who create a peer-reviewed or public
    service/outreach work that is University-owned under the provisions
    of Section II are delegated authority to transfer the copyright in
    that work to a publisher without administrative intervention,
    provided all of the following conditions are met:

    a.  such transfer is agreed to in advance by the complete set of
        authors,
    b.  the work in question was not directly commissioned by the
        University,
    c.  neither the authors nor their unit(s) will receive compensation
        for such transfer,
    d.  such transfer is reported promptly to the University via the
        administrative system provided for that purpose,
    e.  except for the transfer of copyright, the transfer agreement
        does not contractually bind the University,
    f.  the work and the copyright transfer do not violate third party
        rights, and
    g.  the work and the copyright transfer otherwise conform to
        scholarly norms.

    This authorization may be extended to works involving compensation
    of authors and/or units where such compensation does not exceed a
    level periodically approved by the University.

3.  All other use, licensing, and/or sale of University-owned works
    external to the University (for example, use by educational
    institutions other than the University, by government and other
    non-profit institutions, and use resulting from lease or other
    contractual arrangements for commercial distribution of the works)
    may be undertaken by the University at its discretion following
    receipt of a written memorandum from all University Authors of the
    work, agreeing to such external use, licensing, and/or sale. Such
    agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

**Section VII \-- Revision of University-Owned Works**

1.  The University Author(s) of a University-owned work may revise it at
    any time, provided that the revision does not require substantial
    University resources, and that he/she gives the University and other
    University Authors of the work (if any) notice of the revision. When
    substantial University resources are required for an
    author-initiated revision of a University-owned work, the University
    Authors shall request advance approval of the resource allocation
    from the unit(s) sponsoring the work^5 ^and/or providing the
    resources.
2.  All surviving University Authors primarily responsible for the
    creation of a University-owned work must concur in its revision,
    unless the work was directly commissioned by the University
3.  The revision of University-owned works that were directly
    commissioned by the University may also be initiated by the
    University at its election, with or without the approval or
    participation of the work\'s original University Authors. However,
    the University Authors of the original work are entitled to
    continuing credit for their contributions to the derivative work
    created through such revision, if they desire to have their names
    associated with the derivative work. In addition, if the derivative
    work is externally sold or licensed, the University Authors of the
    original work are entitled to such participation in University
    Author royalty sharing under Section VIII as may be equitable in the
    specific circumstances.

**Section VIII \-- Payments to University Authors**

1.  a\) If the University markets a University-owned work for external use,
    any net income actually received by the University (after the documented
    cost of production, sales, advertising, distribution and any unrecovered
    overhead, but not to include the costs of original development unless so
    stipulated in the contract or grant) shall be distributed so that the
    University Author (or all University Authors collectively if there is
    more than one) receives the first \$5,000 of such net income, 50% of the
    next \$20,000, 30% of the next \$50,000, and 25% of all additional net
    income. The University shall retain and use the remainder of the net
    income to encourage further development of copyrightable works.

    b\) If the University contracts with a third party to reproduce and sell
    a University-owned work, the total royalties shall be negotiated between
    the University (after consultation with the University Author(s)) and
    the third party, and the net income shall be distributed to the
    University Author(s) and retained and used by the University in
    accordance with the schedule and for the purpose set forth above.

2.  If a University-owned work prepared for use in another unit of the
    University is used for extension instruction with the advice and
    assistance of its University Author(s), then Michigan State
    University Extension, in accordance with its existing policies, may
    make additional payment to the University Author(s) for such advice
    and assistance.
3.  A University Author may be compensated for use of University-owned
    video materials in which the University Author personally and
    prominently appears, when such materials are used while the
    University Author is not on assignment with the University (e.g.,
    when the University Author is not appointed during summer session,
    or is on leave). Compensation should be mutually agreed upon in
    advance by the University Author and the unit(s) involved, based
    upon (a) the amount of continuing responsibility of the University
    Author for the use of the University-owned video material; (b)
    whether the University-owned video material is complete in itself or
    embedded in another work; and (c) the extent to which the University
    Author\'s time and creative efforts have previously been
    compensated. As a guideline for works in video format, the
    University author may be compensated on the basis of load credit or
    salary equal to 1% of the annual salary for each six video hours
    developed. Such payment or credit should be limited to a period of
    two years.

**Section IX \-- Transfer of Rights to University Author**
:::

If the University discontinues use of University-owned instructional
materials in their existing form for more than two years, if no revision
is in process, if the University is not otherwise bound by grant or
contract, and if all living University Authors of the instructional
materials so request in writing, the University shall transfer the
copyrights in such instructional materials to the University Author(s),
provided that the University Author(s) shall be required to pay all
costs associated with the transfer, including expenses associated with
copying, mailing and handling, duplication and copyright transfer, but
not to include original costs of production.

**Section X \-- Protection and Liability**

1.  Protection \
    1.  The Office of the Provost shall investigate allegations of
        unauthorized use or copyright infringement of University-owned
        works and shall recommend appropriate action. If the University
        initiates legal action in response to an unauthorized use or
        infringement, all costs of such action (including attorney\'s
        fees) shall be borne by the University, which shall control the
        action. All net proceeds of such action in excess of such costs
        shall be shared by the University and the University Author(s)
        is accord with the formula set forth in Section VIII-1(a).
    2.  If the University decides not to initiate legal action, the
        University Author(s) may do so, and the University shall assign
        to the University Author(s) such rights as are necessary for the
        limited purpose of pursuing redress for the unauthorized use or
        infringement. Costs of such action (including attorney\'s fees)
        shall be borne by the University Author(s) who shall have the
        right to all proceeds resulting from that action.
2.  <div>

    Liability

    </div>

    1.  The University Author(s) of a University-owned work shall obtain
        appropriate written releases, granting all necessary rights to
        the University to allow the full exercise of its copyright in
        the work. These releases shall be kept by the unit producing the
        work until such time as the work is withdrawn from circulation.
    2.  Before any external use is made of a University-owned work, the
        University Author(s) shall certify in writing to the Office of
        the Provost that the work does not infringe any existing
        copyright or other legal right held by third parties.
    3.  In the event third parties assert claims against the University
        and/or University Author(s) arising out of or related to a
        University-owned work, the University shall assume
        responsibility for the defense and control of any legal action
        arising from such claims, in accordance with the University\'s
        Indemnification Policy.

::: {xmlns=""}
**Section XI \-- Implementation**
:::

This Policy shall take effect upon approval by the Board of Trustees and
shall be administered and interpreted by the Office of the Provost.
