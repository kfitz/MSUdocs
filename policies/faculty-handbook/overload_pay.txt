**Overload Pay**

 Last updated: 5/5/2006

**ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on October
16, 1970 and revised on May 5, 2006.  (A college may establish a more
restrictive policy.)*

**I. Applicability**

This Policy applies to full-time faculty members (tenure system and
fixed term) at the rank of instructor through professor, full-time
academic staff (including specialists, librarians, and extension field
service staff), full-time executive managers, and full-time academic
administrators (e.g.,** **deans, department chairs, and school
directors).

**II. Overload Pay**

Faculty and academic staff may request approval for overload pay for
overload assignments related to teaching, research, outreach activities,
and academic and student support activities.  Executive managers and
academic administrators may request approval for overload pay for
overload assignments related to their administrative duties and/or
expertise.^1^

**III. Required Approval**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Overload pay assignments require prior written approval (a) by the
    immediate supervisor of the individual who will undertake the
    proposed overload pay assignment; (b) by the administrator of the
    major administrative unit (\"MAU\") in which that individual is
    appointed; and (c) if the unit in which the overload pay assignment
    is to be performed is different from the unit in which the
    individual is appointed, by the administrator of, and the MAU
    administrator for, the unit in which the overload pay assignment is
    to be performed.
2.  In order to be approved, an overload pay assignment must meet the
    following minimum criteria:\
    -   The individual requesting overload pay must have a full-time
        assignment in her/his department, school, or other
        administrative unit and be satisfactorily performing her/his
        assigned duties; and
    -   The individual\'s immediate supervisor, after consultation with
        the administrator of the MAU in which the individual is
        appointed, must determine that:
        -   the proposed assignment represents a substantial increase
            over the individual\'s regularly assigned duties; and
        -   after considering the other commitments of the individual,
            including her/his regularly assigned duties, approved
            outside work for pay, and other professional obligations,
            the proposed assignment will not adversely affect the
            individual\'s performance of her/his regularly assigned
            duties.
3.  The approval of each overload pay assignment must be recorded on the
    Overload Pay form.
:::

**IV. Summer Appointments**

Faculty and academic staff members appointed on an academic year basis
may have part-time or full-time summer appointments in teaching,
research, and/or outreach.  The salary for such a summer appointment may
not exceed 3/9 of the faculty or academic staff member\'s salary during
the previous academic year.  These summer appointments are not
considered overload pay assignments and are not subject to this Policy. 
However, faculty and academic staff members who hold full-time summer
appointments are also eligible for overload pay assignments during the
summer if such assignments are made pursuant to this Policy.

**V. Other Provisions**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  The Office of the Provost shall provide an annual summary of
    overload pay disbursements made during the prior fiscal year to
    appropriate MAU administrators.
2.  In recognition of collegial expectations usual in a community of
    scholars, University units may not pay honoraria to faculty members,
    academic staff, executive managers, or academic administrators for
    talks, seminars, etc., provided in usual classroom/seminar settings.
3.  Individuals performing overload pay assignments pursuant to this
    Policy remain subject to the same University policies and procedures
    as are in effect during the performance of their regularly assigned
    duties.
4.  Assignments which might normally justify the payment of overload pay
    may, by mutual agreement, be compensated for by subsequent release
    time for research, the assignment of additional graduate
    assistants/other support staff, or other forms of
    programmatic/professional support instead of by overload pay.
5.  Major administrative units may establish lower maximum time limits
    for overload pay than those stipulated in this Policy.
