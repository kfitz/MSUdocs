**Preamble**

::: {xmlns=""}
**II. ORGANIZATION**\
\
Under its bylaws and Michigan\'s Constitution, the Board of Trustees has
the responsibility to develop a free and distinguished university and to
promote the welfare of mankind through teaching, research and public
service. The Board of Trustees exercises final authority and
responsibility for University governance within the bounds fixed by the
State Constitution.
:::

In exercising its responsibility the Board delegates to the president,
and through him or her, to the faculty appropriate authority and
jurisdiction over matters for which they are accountable to the Board.
In other cases, for example, faculty appointments, promotions, and
tenure, the Board does not delegate, but instead instead looks to the
faculty for recommendations. The specific powers delegated to the
faculty are detailed in the *Bylaws of the Board of Trustees*.

The Board also has declared its intention to give due consideration to
the opinions of students on matters directly related to their interest.

It is important to specify the manner and process by which the faculty
and students develop and communicate their views to the President and
the Board. These *Bylaws for Academic Governance* are designed to
provide an effective system for the participation of faculty and
students in the development of policy on academic matters.\
