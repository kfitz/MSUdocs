**Academic Freedom**

::: {xmlns=""}
**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**
:::

Michigan State University adheres to the principles of academic freedom
with correlative responsibilities as stated by the American Association
of University Professors, the Association of American Colleges and other
organizations:

Teachers^1^ are entitled to full freedom in research and in the
publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of their
other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return should be based
upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution. \
\
Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their
subject, but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching
controversial matter which has no relation to their subject. Limitations
of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the
institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the
appointment. \
\
College and university teachers are citizens, members of a learned
profession, and officers of an educational institution. When they speak
or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship
or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes
special obligations. As scholars and educational officers, they should
remember that the public may judge their profession and their
institution by their utterances. Hence, they should at all times be
accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for
the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that
they are not speaking for the institution.^2^
