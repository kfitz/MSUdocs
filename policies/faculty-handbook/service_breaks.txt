**Bridging Breaks in Service**

 Last updated: 11/4/2011

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

::: {xmlns=""}
*The following policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on August
16, 1982 and revised on November 4, 2011.*

To provide a consistent definition of continuing employment for
University employees, the policy for bridging breaks in service provides
that service breaks for faculty/academic staff of twelve months or less
result in the reinstatement of the previous employment date for purposes
of retirement service credit and for benefit eligibility. To bridge
breaks in service, the following conditions must be met:

1.  The employee must have a minimum of one year of service prior to the
    break in employment; and,
2.  The maximum accumulation of bridged time is two years, i.e., the sum
    total of individual breaks in service cannot exceed two years.

Approved leaves of absence or sabbatical leaves do not constitute a
break in service.
:::

This policy will be implemented automatically by the Office of Academic
Human Resources at the time individuals are subsequently reappointed.
For individuals seeking to clarify their continuing employment status,
it will be necessary to submit a written request to Academic Human
Resources, Suite 110 Nisbet Building. The following information should
be included in the written request: (1) Name (indicate if previously
employed under a different name); (2) Social Security Number, (3)
Present Department; (4) Previous Employment Date; (5) Separation Date;
and (6) Re-employment Date.

Questions regarding the bridging policy should be directed to Academic
Human Resources, 517-355-1526; contact Human Resources, 517-353-4434,
regarding eligibility for benefit coverages.\
