**Identification Cards**

**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES *(Cont.)***

All members of the faculty and academic staff are encouraged to obtain
identification cards. The identification cards are useful for campus
privileges.  It is inappropriate to alter, falsify or misuse an MSU I.D.
card.

To obtain an ID card, the faculty/academic staff member may visit the ID
Office located in Room 170 International Center, 8:00-4:45 p.m., Monday
through Friday. A government issued ID (driver license, passport,
etc.) is necessary for processing.

Spouses of faculty and academic staff may obtain IDs entitling them to
certain privileges. To obtain the spouse card, the employee and spouse
must both appear in person, present the employee\'s Michigan State
University ID, proof of marriage, and a government issued photo such as
a driver\'s license or passport. There is no charge for the initial
card.\
