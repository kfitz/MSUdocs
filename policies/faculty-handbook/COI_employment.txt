**Conflict of Interest in Employment**

 Last updated: 12/8/1995

**III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (*Cont.*)**

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on December
8, 1995 as a replacement for the Employment of Relatives policy.*

Standards for hiring, promotion, reappointment, evaluation, working
conditions, responsibilities, salary and termination for all employees
at Michigan State University are based on ability, qualifications for
the position, and performance. Relationship (meaning connection between
persons, hereinafter referred to as \"relatives,\" by blood, marriage,
adoption, domestic partnership, or other personal relationship in which
objectivity might be impaired) to another individual employed by the
University shall not constitute a bar to hiring, promotion or
reappointment; provided, however, that no employee shall be under the
direct supervision or control of a \"relative.\" Employment of
\"relatives\" in the same unit or department or under the same
supervisor is authorized only with the prior written approval of the
head of the unit or department and the Office of the Provost or the
Office of Human Resource Services, as appropriate. In addition,
\"relatives\" should not participate in roles which have the potential
for influencing employment decisions, e.g., peer review.

General Principles:

1.  To avoid possible conflicts of interest, any dean, director,
    chairperson/supervisor or participant in peer or administrative
    review procedures who is a \"relative\" of an employee or job
    applicant must not participate either formally or informally in
    decisions (including rendering advice on decisions) on personnel
    matters affecting the \"relative,\" including, but not limited to,
    decisions to hire, retain, promote or determine the salary.
2.  In cases where a chairperson/supervisor has primary responsibility
    for evaluation or for assignment of duties (e.g., a department
    chairperson\'s supervision of faculty in the department), no
    employee may supervise a \"relative.\" An appropriate individual
    must be designated by a higher level of administrator (e.g., dean,
    director, provost, vice president, president) to perform the
    functions of chairperson/supervisor in decisions to hire, retain,
    promote, assign duties or set the salary of the individual
    \"related\" to the chairperson/supervisor.
3.  Within the limitations set forth above, individuals \"related\" to
    other MSU employees have all general rights extended to employees in
    comparable positions. For example, a faculty member has the right to
    serve on a departmental peer review committee even though a
    \"relative\" will be considered by the committee; the faculty
    member, however, would not participate in the review of the
    \"relative.\"
4.  Supervision and evaluation procedures, even when altered, should
    ensure comparable treatment of employees.
5.  In circumstances which have the potential for the conflicts of
    interest referenced in item \#1, above, individuals have the
    responsibility for disclosing that a conflict of interest may exist
    to the department chairperson, school director, dean or other
    relevant administrator or supervisor; the specifics of the potential
    conflict do not have to be provided.

Decisions about individual cases should be made on the basis of these
principles. In cases where the application of a principle is disputed,
the administrator/supervisor at the next level may be asked to assist in
resolution. The Office of the Provost/Office of the Vice President for
Finance and Operations has final approval regarding application of the
general principles to particular cases.\
