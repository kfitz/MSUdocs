Leave is granted to care for an employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care; to care for an employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job.

            <strong>Severe Weather</strong>                   <br/>In the event of severe weather conditions, only student employees whose services are required for maintenance, food service and other essential operations should report to work. Supervisors must advise student employees of reporting requirements at the time they are hired. Students should be paid at their normal rate for the hours they actually work during a period of severe weather. Students who do not work will not be paid.</p>

            <strong>Driver And Chauffeur Licenses</strong>               </p>
         <div xmlns="" style="text-align: left;">
            <ul>
               <li>There are several student employee job descriptions that require driver and/or chauffeur licenses for student employees. All departments should review the duties being performed by their student employees as far as driving motor vehicles is concerned and, where necessary, require that student employees obtain a chauffeur license. In addition, when recruiting to fill vacancies, requisitions should clearly state those instances where chauffeur licenses are required.</li>
               <li>Where an employee is required to operate a motor vehicle for the purpose of transporting merchandise or persons on a regular basis, that employee should be required to possess a chauffeur license. A chauffeur license should be required where a primary responsibility is the operation of a motor vehicle with a seating capacity of twelve or more persons or which is regularly involved in the delivery of goods and materials on the public highway.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Summer Hiring</strong>                  
<ul>
               <li>An individual may be considered a student employee if s/he has been assigned a student number, has attended AOP, and/or has been admitted/readmitted for fall semester, and is enrolled for summer or fall semester classes.</li>
               <li>A student hired for summer semester cannot begin working until the semester officially starts if s/he was not enrolled spring semester, or, if a new student, until they have gone through AOP and have signed up for fall classes.</li>
               <li>The procedure for processing student employees will be the same as during the academic year.</li>
               <li>Students who are to continue working during the summer in the same job they held spring semester do not need to be reprocessed for employment.</li>
               <li>Students may work up to 40 hours per week during summer semester. However, departments will only be reimbursed for 29 hours per week for Work-Study students.</li>
               <li>Students must be paid time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. The additional straight hours are paid by the department where the hours were reported and the overtime premium is split proportionately between the units based on how many total hours they have worked in each department.</li>
               <li>A student who graduates or is not returning to classes Summer or Fall Semester may stay on Student Employee payroll until the second week of June(exact date will be communicated via MSU Pathways).</li>
               <li>A student employed on the Graduate Assistant and Student payrolls may not exceed 40 hours a week for all students including international students on the combined payrolls.</li>
