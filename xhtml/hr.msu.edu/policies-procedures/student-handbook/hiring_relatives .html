            <ul>
               <li>Standards for employment and promotion of student employees at Michigan State University shall consist of ability, qualifications for the position, and performance. Relationship (meaning a person connected by blood or affinity) to another individual employed by the University shall not constitute a bar to hiring or promotion; provided, however, that no employee shall be assigned to a unit or department under the direct supervision or control of a relative. Employment of relatives in the same unit or department or under the same supervisor is authorized only with prior written approval of the head of the unit or department and the Office of the Provost (for academic departments) or the Office of the Vice President for Finance &amp; Operations (for non-academic departments).</li>
               <li>A student and a related regular full-time (non-student) employee may be employed in the same unit or department or under the same supervisor if prior written approval is obtained.</li>
               <li>The employment of related students in the same unit or department is permitted if prior written approval is obtained.</li>
            </ul>
