The following practices for employing students should be reviewed by departments and appropriate action taken.</div>

         <h2 xmlns="" style="text-align: left;">Interviewing</h2>
         <div xmlns="" style="text-align: left;">Interviews should be non-discriminatory and are for the purpose of allowing the job applicants to learn about the position and the work setting, and for the interviewer to find the best fit for the position.</div>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li style="text-align: left;">Remain within legal guidelines. Under the <a title="Americans with Disabilities Act"
                  href="/policies-procedures/student-handbook/Section-Laws-Regulations.html">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, employers are prohibited from discriminating against an individual based on disability status in employment practices such as hiring, wages and termination. Also, Michigan State University's <a title="Anti-Discrimination Policy"
                  href="/policies-procedures/university-wide/index.html">Anti-Discrimination Policy</a> prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, color, gender, handicap, height, marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, Vietnam-era veteran status, or weight. You can find a reproduction of the <a title="Pre-Employment Guide from Michigan Department of Civil Rights"
                  href="/policies-procedures/student-handbook/index.html">Pre-Employment Inquiry Guide</a>, published by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights provides information on what questions may and may not legally be asked of an applicant.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">During the interview, both parties should come to an an understanding of expectations.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">Departments must inform all applicants of the essential functions of the position including. You can refer to the list of <a title="student employee positons PDF"

                  target="_blank">student employee positions</a>.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">A structured interview insures that all candidates for the position are asked the same questions in the same way. Pre-employment testing is not permitted. It is best to have a list of questions to ask all candidates. Questions can be open-ended ("Can you give me an example of ... ? "), or "yes" or "no" answers ("Can you operate a ... ?"). You need to be specific on necessary information concerning driving a car or other skills essential to the position. It is risky to assume anything. Some sample questions might be:
<ul>
                  <li>We need the student employee to be available for 12 hours a week. Are you able to be here 12 hours a week, including final exam week?</li>
                  <li>What computer software programs are you proficient in?</li>
                  <li>Do you have a valid vehicle operator's license?</li>
                  <li>Do you enjoy meeting and greeting people?</li>
                  <li>Tell me/us what you enjoyed most about your last job. Why?</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">Pre-Employment testing is not permitted</li>

               <li>Hiring Students: All MSU departments must use the Enterprise Business System (EBS) Portal to process new hires.</li>
               <li>Medical Exams: Some positions may require medical/physical examinations for employment. Medical exams may not be performed until after a job offer has been made and accepted. All information resulting from such an exam is confidential and should be maintained outside of the student's employment file. Any medical information currently in a student's employment file should be removed. An employee's written request for accommodation and documentation related to the accommodation (other than medical records) may be kept in the student's medical file.</li>
