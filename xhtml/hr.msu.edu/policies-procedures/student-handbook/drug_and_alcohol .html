            <strong>The following is Michigan State University's Drug and Alcohol Policy for employees and students. </strong>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Employees </strong> 
            <sup>(1)</sup> 
            <br/>Consistent with state and federal Law, Michigan State University will maintain a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance <sup>(2)</sup> . The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs and alcohol are prohibited on any property under control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of Michigan State University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline, any employee involved in the unlawful, use, sale, manufacturing, dispensing or possession of controlled substances, illicit drugs and alcohol on University premises or work sites, or working under the influence of such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The employee must notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) calendar days after such conviction. Failure to provide such notice will subject the employee to discipline up to and including dismissal pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline. The employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, who will report the incident to the Office of Human Resources, Academic Human Resources or MSU Student Employment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Michigan State University supports and sponsors programs aimed at the prevention of substance abuse by University employees. The <a title="Employee Assistance Program"
               href="http://eap.msu.edu/"
               target="_blank">Employee Assistance Program</a> provides preventative programs and counseling for employees experiencing substance-dependency problems. Assistance is available on a voluntary basis. Leaves of absence to obtain treatment may be obtained under the medical leave provision of the appropriate labor contract or policy.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <sup>(1)</sup> This policy applies to all University employees, including but not limited to: faculty, academic staff, support staff and student employees.<br/>
            <sup>(2) </sup>Five schedules of controlled substances are defined in the comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21. U.S.C. 812.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Students</strong> 
            <br/>Michigan State University's compliance with provisions of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 applying to students is achieved through a comprehensive alcohol and other drug prevention program which includes policy enforcement, education programs and treatment services.</p>
         <p xmlns="">General Student Regulations 2.06 and 2.07 prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students on Michigan State University property or as part of any of its activities. These regulations are as follows:<br/>2.06 "No student shall possess, use, manufacture, produce, sell, exchange or otherwise distribute any drug prohibited by federal or state laws."<br/>2.07 "No student shall possess, consume, furnish, manufacture, sell, exchange or otherwise distribute any alcoholic beverages except as permitted by state law and University ordinance."</p>
         <p xmlns="">Alleged violations of MSU regulations are adjudicated through the MSU student judicial process. Consequences for violations may include, but are not limited to, some form of disciplinary probation, required attendance at educational programs, referral for assessment and treatment, relocation to a new living environment, and suspension from Michigan State University for sale of illegal drugs or repeated violations of the regulations. In addition, students can expect to be arrested and fined for violations of State Law on campus.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Michigan State University supports and sponsors programs aimed at the prevention of substance abuse by students. Information about education and treatment services may be obtained from the <a title="Employee Assistance Program"
