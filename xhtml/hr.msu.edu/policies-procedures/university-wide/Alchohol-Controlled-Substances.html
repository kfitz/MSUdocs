<ul>
                              <li>Pre-employment: Departments notify MSU Human Resources on the Exposure to Health Risks form of any employees being hired or transferred into a position requiring a CDL. MSU Human Resources shares this information with Olin Health Center, which ensures that pre-employment tests are completed with satisfactory results, prior to the driver performing safety-sensitive functions. Prior to this testing, Olin obtains the driver's signature on the <a title="Pre-Employment Testing Consent Form "
                                    href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/employment/documents/PreEmployTestConsent.pdf"

                              <li>Random: Olin Health Center notifies departments of drivers randomly selected for alcohol or controlled substances testing. Departments provide the selected driver with the <a title="Drug Testing Procedures Driver Fact Sheet"
                                    href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/employment/support-staff/documents/DriverFactSheet.pdf"
                                    target="_blank">Drug Testing Procedures Driver Fact Sheet</a> and ensure that he/she proceeds to Olin Health Center immediately for testing. If the driver is performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of notification, the department ensures that the driver ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to Olin as soon as possible. Random alcohol testing is limited to the time period surrounding the performance of safety-related functions, i.e., during, just before, or just after performing safety-sensitive functions. Controlled substances testing may be performed at any time while the driver is at work for the employer.</li>
                              <li>Post-accident:</li>
                              <li>When an accident occurs with an MSU vehicle and CDL driver which involves property damage, a fatality, or the MSU CDL driver receiving a citation for a moving traffic violation, the driver calls the department which immediately (or as soon as practicable, but not to exceed 8 hours) calls Olin Health Center (517-353-9137) to arrange for alcohol and controlled substances testing.</li>
                              <li>If an alcohol test is not administered within 2 hours following the accident, a record must be prepared by the supervisor and retained stating the reason a test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test is not administered within 8 hours following the accident, the test will not be conducted and a record as described above will be prepared and retained. If a controlled substances test is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, the test will not be conducted and a record as described above will be prepared and retained.</li>
                              <li>A driver who is subject to post-accident testing shall remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. Automotive Services will place a copy of the Post-Accident Drug Testing Procedures form and Testing Kit (available from Olin Health Center) in each commercial motor vehicle (CMV) with instructions on how to proceed in case of an accident.</li>
                              <li>Reasonable suspicion: When a trained supervisor or MSU official observes behavior, appearance, speech or body odors of a driver that are characteristic of alcohol and/or controlled substances abuse, including indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances, the department will notify Olin Health Center (517-353-9137) and take the driver to Olin Health Center for an alcohol and/or controlled substances test. Testing is done only if the observations are made during, just before, or just after the period of the work day the driver is required to be in compliance.</li>
                              <li>If an alcohol test is not administered within 2 hours of the observations, a record must be prepared by the supervisor and retained stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test is not administered within 8 hours of the observations, the test will not be conducted and a record as described above will be prepared and retained. If a controlled substances test is not administered within 32 hours of the observations, the test will not be conducted and a record as described above will be prepared and retained.</li>
                              <li>An <a title="Observed Behavior/Resonable Cause Form"
                                    href="/ua/forms/documents/ReasonableCause.pdf"
                                    target="_blank">Observed Behavior -- Reasonable Cause Record form</a>, signed by the supervisor, will be made of the observations leading to the testing within 24 hours of the observed behavior or before the test results are released, whichever is earlier. When it is not feasible or impossible to conduct a reasonable suspicion alcohol test in a timely manner, the employee is not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions for 8 hours (or until a Preliminary Breath Test [PBT] result below 0.02 becomes available during this 8-hour period).</li>
                              <li>Return to duty: Before a driver is returned to duty after engaging in prohibited conduct regarding alcohol or controlled substances abuse, departments must send the driver to Olin Health Center for return-to-duty alcohol or controlled substances abuse testing and an authorization to return to safety-sensitive functions.</li>
                              <li>Follow-up: Following a determination that a driver is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol and/or controlled substances abuse, the driver is subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a substance abuse professional. Olin Health Center will notify departments of alcohol and/or controlled substances abuse follow-up testing required for the affected driver. Departments are to ensure that the driver proceeds immediately to Olin Health Center for testing.</li>

                     <strong>Violations (positive or refused tests)</strong> 
                     <br/> When alcohol and/or controlled substances violations occur, i.e., a person tests positive or refuses testing, departments are responsible for ensuring that:</p>
                  <div xmlns="" style="text-align: left;">
                     <ul>
                        <li>drivers are not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions, e.g., if blood alcohol content (BAC) is greater than or equal to 0.02, for a minimum of 24 hours,</li>
                        <li>appropriate follow-up and return-to-duty testing occurs,</li>
                        <li>initial referral to Employee Assistance Program for subsequent referral to a substance abuse professional occurs, e.g., if BAC is greater than or equal to 0.04, and</li>
                        <li>follow-up evaluations are made to ensure that the rehabilitation program was followed prior to return to work.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p xmlns="">When an employee is not permitted to perform safety sensitive functions, he/she may be suspended without pay pending investigation, and disciplinary action may be taken up to and including discharge. In hiring situations, the contingent employment offer is rescinded.</p>
                  <p xmlns="">The following resources are available to assist in these situations:</p>
                  <div xmlns="" style="text-align: left;">
                     <ul>
                        <li>MSU Human Resources Employee Relations for disciplinary action (517-353-5510),</li>
                        <li>Olin Health Center for subsequent alcohol and controlled substances testing (517-353-9137), and</li>
                        <li>MSU Human Resources Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for referrals to substance abuse professionals (517-355-4506).</li>
                     </ul>
If the tests are positive, the medical review officer (MRO) will contact the employee to discuss the positive test results.</div>
                  <p xmlns="">Substance Abuse Professional (SAP): The role of the SAP is that of a professional "gatekeeper" in the testing protocol. In this context, the responsibility of the SAP is both prescriptive and advisory. The SAP evaluates the employee, prescribes an appropriate course of rehabilitation, advises the employer whether or not the employee has properly followed the rehabilitation plan, and prescribes a program of follow-up testing. Each of these professional judgments may impact public safety. The SAP's safety duty to the University for evaluation and prescription may transcend the SAP's customary professional loyalty to the employee.</p>
                  <p xmlns="">The University remains ultimately responsible for the decision to conduct the return-to-duty test; for the decision to return the employee to safety-sensitive duties; and for the implementation of the follow-up testing plan. Given the potential for poly-drug misuse, the SAP may recommend return-to-duty or follow-up alcohol testing where an employee tested positive for drugs and the SAP has reason to suspect alcohol misuse. The opposite would be true as well.</p>
                  <p xmlns="">Release of test results: Olin Health Center will report test results to the department and the employee using the <a title="Test Results Notification Form"
                        href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/employment/support-staff/documents/ControlledSubstanceTestResults.pdf"
                        target="_blank">Controlled Substances Test Results Notification form</a>. MSU Human Resources Employee Relations will be informed of positive test results. Test results and other confidential information may only be released to the employer and the SAP (when known). Any other release of information is only with the driver's consent. If a driver initiates a grievance, hearing, lawsuit or other action as a result of a violation of these rules, the employer may release information to the decision maker.</p>
                  <p xmlns="">Retention of records/reporting: MSU Human Resources Employee Relations is responsible for retaining records related to education and training. Olin Health Center is responsible for retaining records related to the collection process, driver's test results, drug testing, and reporting as required under the regulations. The SAP will retain records on her/his evaluations and the driver's compliance with her/his recommendations.</p>
                  <p xmlns="">Time lost from work: Time lost from work for alcohol or controlled substances testing, including travel time, will be considered paid time, i.e., considered "on-duty" time. Time lost from work for alcohol and/or controlled substances abuse counseling and rehabilitation will be administered based on existing University policies and procedures for paid and unpaid leave (see Policy and Procedure for vacation pay, sick leave, personal leave, and disciplinary action).</p>
