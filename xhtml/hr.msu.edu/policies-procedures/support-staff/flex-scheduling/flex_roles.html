            <strong>Employees considering flexible work arrangements should:</strong>
         </div>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Think through which flexible schedule options will meet both your needs and the needs of your unit.</li>
               <li>Discuss your interest in a flexible work arrangement with your supervisor/manager.</li>
               <li>Ask for assistance or guidance from Human Resources and/or the MSU WorkLife Office.</li>
               <li>Seek advice/suggestions from other individuals who are working a flexible schedule.</li>
               <li>Consider how the arrangement you are considering would impact your work and the work of your colleagues and include their feedback and needs in your considerations.</li>
               <li>Prepare a proposal and schedule time to discuss it with your supervisor.</li>
               <li>Discuss your proposal with your supervisor and work out a mutually agreeable arrangement.</li>
               <li>Make sure you and your supervisor have clarified all details or concerns and hold the same expectations.</li>
               <li>Try out the new schedule as a pilot arrangement. Monitor the success and challenges together, and evaluate the arrangement periodically with your supervisor.</li>

         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Consider the potential improvement of business/department needs when assessing flexible schedule proposals from employees.</li>
               <li>Seek input from other employees since a flexible schedule for one employee can impact all team members.</li>
               <li>Consider each proposal on its own merits.</li>
               <li>Seek feedback from colleagues experienced with supporting flexible work options.</li>
               <li>Ask for assistance or guidance from Human Resources.</li>
               <li>Clarify all expectations with the employee before implementing a flexible work schedule and discuss any questions or concerns. Consider adopting the new schedule as a pilot arrangement with a timeline.</li>
               <li>Communicate the new arrangement to other staff in the department and appropriate administrators.</li>
               <li>Monitor the successes and challenges.</li>

         <p xmlns="">Alternative work arrangements may require some adjustment in management style on the part of supervisors and may also require adjustments in communication to maintain accountability. The following steps can be helpful:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Develop systems and structures that allow employees to respond to ever-changing work demands, such as having a back-up plan for coverage and communication when unexpected situations arise.</li>
               <li>Communicate explicitly and consistently about standards for accountability, quality and timeliness.</li>
               <li>Create a comfortable environment where employees can share concerns and creative ideas with you.</li>
               <li>Be open to experimenting.</li>
            </ul>
