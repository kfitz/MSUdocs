         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> Regular 50% time or more faculty and academic staff, and regular full-time University support staff and flexible appointees</p>
         <p xmlns="">The University provides a Basic Employer-Paid Life Insurance benefit for eligible employees.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Summary of benefits</strong>: The benefit is payable in the event of the employee's death.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The benefit is an amount of insurance equal to the employee's base annual salary. Accrued sick leave, vacation, personal leave and longevity pay are included in the Basic Employer-Paid Life Insurance benefit payment, not in addition to it.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The maximum benefit is $50,000.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Premium contribution: </strong>The University pays the entire cost of the benefit.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Application for enrollment: </strong>No application is necessary. Coverage is automatic.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Designation of a beneficiary is optional. If not specified, the benefit proceeds are paid to the beneficiary indicated by the employee for their Optional Employee-Paid Life Insurance policy, if any.</p>
         <p xmlns="">If no beneficiary is designated, payment is made to the survivors in the first surviving class of those that follow:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>spouse,</li>
               <li>children (divided equally, if more than one exists),</li>
               <li>parents (divided equally if more than one exists),</li>
               <li>brothers/sisters (divided equally if more than one exists), or</li>
               <li>if none survives, then payment is made to the employee's estate.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Effective date of benefit:</strong> Coverage is effective immediately the first active work day.</div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Termination date of benefit:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>The Basic Employer-Paid Life Insurance benefit terminates on the employee's last day of active employment or transfer to an ineligible status (VARIES: Clerical Technical Union employees who gain eligibility for coverage as a full-time employee, and change to part-time status of 50% or more, will remain covered on a proportional basis).</li>
               <li>The benefit terminates 180 days from the last day paid for employees on leave of absence (including layoff) for any reason. It is reinstated automatically upon return to eligible active employment (<a title="Flexible Appointments"
                     href="/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/flex_appt.html">for flex appointees, see Policy and Procedure for flexible appointments)</a>.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Conversion of coverage: </strong>Coverage may be converted by directly contacting the carrier within 31 days of termination of coverage.</p>

            <strong>Enrollment in benefit plan:</strong> <br/>Employee:</p>
