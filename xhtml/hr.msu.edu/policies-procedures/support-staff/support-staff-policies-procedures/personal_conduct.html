         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to</strong>: University support staff</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Rules of Personal Conduct for Employees are intended to promote the orderly and efficient operation of Michigan State University, as well as to protect the rights of all employees. Violations, therefore, shall be regarded as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Discharge may result from an accumulation of minor infractions, or for a single serious infraction.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Disciplinary action under these rules does not preclude an employee from discipline for violation of University policies or ordinances, criminal liability or sanctions for violation of local, state or federal laws.</p>
         <p xmlns="">These rules do not preclude any University department from establishing additional rules for its employees that are necessary for the effective operation of that department. This is not a comprehensive list of rules, and the University reserves the right to discipline employees for acts or omissions not stated below. </p>
         <p xmlns="">Each employee is required to conduct himself/herself in a professional manner at all times. The following are examples of prohibited conduct:</p>
         <p xmlns="">1. Sexual Harassment:</p>
         <p xmlns="">Sexual harassment is a form of unlawful gender (sex) discrimination and is not tolerated at Michigan State University. All employees should be familiar with the <a title="University Policy on Relationship Violence &amp; Sexual Misconduct"
               href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/RVSM_policy.html"
               target="_blank">University Policy on Relationship Violence &amp; Sexual Misconduct</a> available on the web.</p>
         <p xmlns="">2. Sexual Conduct: Behavior of a sexual nature that is not sexual harassment may, nonetheless, be unprofessional in the workplace, disruptive in the classroom or violate other University policies; and, like other behavior that is unprofessional, disruptive, or violates a University policy or ordinance, it could warrant discipline.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Many types of behavior may constitute sexual harassment or sexual conduct including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>Sexual assault</li>
            <li>Threats or insinuations that lead the affected individual reasonably to believe that granting or denying sexual favors will affect his/her reputation, education, employment, advancement, or standing within the University</li>
            <li>Sexual advances, sexual propositions, or sexual demands that are not agreeable to both parties</li>
            <li>Unwelcome and persistent sexually explicit statements or stories that are not related to employment</li>
            <li>Sexually explicit e-mails or text messages</li>
            <li>Sexual misconduct such as stalking, cyber stalking, voyeurism, or recording or transmitting sexual images</li>
            <li>Repeated use of sexually degrading language or sounds to describe a person</li>
            <li>Unwanted and unnecessary touching, patting, hugging, or other physical contact</li>
            <li>Comments or questions about an individual's sexual prowess, sexual deficiencies, or sexual behavior</li>
            <li>Dissemination of sexually explicit materials through the University's information technology resources</li>
            <li>Creation, dissemination, or display of offensive items or materials that disrupt the work environment including, but not limited to, photographs, graphics, symbols or video or audio recordings </li>
         </ul>
         <p xmlns=""> 3. Other Prohibited Harassment or Inappropriate Conduct :</p>
         <p xmlns="">Other Unlawful Harassment may occur when a University community member is subject to unwelcome conduct based on a category protected in the Anti-Discrimination Policy.  These categories include: age, color, gender, gender identity, genetic information, disability status, height, marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight. Unwelcome conduct that is objectively and subjectively severe, persistent or pervasive and creates an unreasonable interference with the individual's work or education experience is considered harassment. For more details, see the <a title="Anti-Discrimination Policy"
               href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/university-wide/ADP_policy.html"
               target="_blank">Anti-Discrimination Policy</a>.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Behavior that is based on a protected category, but does not rise to the level of prohibited harassment under the ADP, may nonetheless be unprofessional in the workplace, disruptive in the classroom, or violate other University policies and, like other behavior that is unprofessional, disruptive, or violates a University policy or ordinance, could warrant discipline.</p>
