         <p xmlns="">Employing Department:</p>
         <p xmlns="">When an employee will be absent from work beyond the date of the reported work-related illness/injury, the department submits an <a href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/benefits/workers-comp/documents/InjuryAbsenceReport.pdf"
               target="_blank">Injury Absence Report</a> to MSU Human Resources. This form is used in place of the regular time report. If an employee has worked for only one hour on the date of reported illness/ injury, he/she should be paid as if he/she were working that day. When an individual is scheduled for overtime on the date of reported illness/injury, he/she must be paid as though the overtime was worked. Payment for paid time is not to be deducted from sick leave, vacation or personal leave accruals. The Injury Absence Report must be received by MSU Human Resources by 5:00 p.m. Monday following each week the employee is absent. All necessary forms for processing a Workers' Compensation claim are obtainable from the <a href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/ua/forms/support-staff.html"
               target="_blank">MSU Human Resources website</a>.</p>
         <p xmlns="">When an employee on layoff or leave of absence (including illness and/or disability leaves due to Workers' Compensation) accepts a work assignment (half-time or greater), the original ending date of the leave may be extended by the number of days employed. The employee's record will indicate both the leave of absence or layoff status (primary) and the temporary employment status (multi-assignment).</p>
