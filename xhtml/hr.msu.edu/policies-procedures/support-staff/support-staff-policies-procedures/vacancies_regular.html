         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>returning from leave of absence,</li>

               <li>The position to be used for bypass is selected by MSU Human Resources from requests submitted for which the individual qualifies.</li>
               <li>When a match-up is made of credentials to job requirements, the department is notified that an individual is to be interviewed and accepted, or submit written reasons for non-selection (including why the individual could not learn to do the job during the appropriate trial, training, requalification or evaluation period). Under normal circumstances, the department is to contact the bypass candidate within three business days of the time the department receives notice of the bypass situation.</li>
               <li>Once the department has met with the bypass candidate, a decision of how to proceed is given. The reasons for non-selection are reviewed by MSU Human Resource to determine the acceptability of the reasons given.</li>
               <li>Other applicants will be held from consideration until the bypass situation is resolved.</li>
               <li>If a department cancels a vacancy after receiving notice that a candidate has been referred as a bypass to the position, the department may not post the same position, similar position or fill the vacancy with a temporary employee for six months from the date the position was posted.</li>
