         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> University support staff</p>
         <p xmlns="">The University has rules governing personal conduct of employees. These rules do not preclude the establishment of additional rules by the individual departments.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Infraction of University or departmental rules shall be regarded as cause for disciplinary action.</p>
         <p xmlns="">All disciplinary action taken must be properly documented as described in the procedure outlined below. Departments shall use the <a title="Notice of Non-Academic Disciplinary action"
               href="/ua/forms/documents/nonAcademicDiscipline.pdf"
               target="_blank">Notice of Non-Academic Disciplinary Action form.</a> </p>
         <p xmlns="">The right to union representation during discussions exists where employees reasonably believe discipline may result. If the employee requests such representation, the employee must be allowed to be accompanied by a union representative at any stage of the disciplinary process. Requests for representation may be denied when the employee is assured no discipline will result from the discussion.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Types of disciplinary action:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Verbal warning - notification and warning to employee.</li>
               <li>Written reprimand - formal notification in writing to employee.</li>
               <li>Suspension - loss of work and wages for a specified number of hours or days.</li>
               <li>Discharge - termination of employment.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Progressive discipline:</strong> The University promotes a policy of progressive or corrective discipline, i.e., discipline shall gradually increase depending upon the severity and/or frequency of the infractions.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Normally, disciplinary action begins with a verbal warning for the first offense and culminates with discharge only after repeated attempts to correct employee's behavior have failed.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Serious infractions may warrant immediate imposition of a written reprimand, suspension or discharge, as appropriate.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Determination of action: </strong>Supervision will determine the action appropriate to the infraction up to and including termination, considering the severity of the offense, mitigating circumstances, previous infractions, etc.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Assistance in determining the appropriate action may be received through MSU Human Resources Employee Relations.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Approval for discharge must be obtained from MSU Human Resources Employee Relations and Human Resource Services in advance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Appeals of discipline: </strong>Grievance procedures are detailed in individual <a title="Union Contracts"
               href="/contracts/index.html"
               target="_blank">Collective Bargaining Agreements</a>.</p>
         <p xmlns="">A <a title="Grievance Procedure"
               href="/grievances/support-staff/procedures.html"
               target="_blank">University grievance procedure</a> is available to those employees not covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
