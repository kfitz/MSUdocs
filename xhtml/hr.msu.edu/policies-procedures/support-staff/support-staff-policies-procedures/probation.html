         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> University support staff</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>General:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>During the probationary period, employees have no assurance of continued employment. Employment during the probationary period may be terminated at any time and for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice.</li>
               <li>Employees serve a probationary period commencing at the time of hire and/or when the employee changes employee group or bargaining unit. An exception occurs when an employee, currently employed at the University in another bargaining unit, enters the 1585 bargaining unit without a break in service. This employee is subject to a 250-working hour trial period rather than a probationary period.</li>
               <li>Employees serve a trial period when changing positions within a bargaining unit.</li>
               <li>Any employee who has successfully completed a probationary period in a bargaining unit and then leaves the bargaining unit and continues University employment in another bargaining unit, and then later returns to the same bargaining unit (regardless of the time away), is required to serve a trial period.</li>
               <li>Probationary and trial periods of bargained-for employees are not extended except through prior approval of MSU Human Resources Employee Relations and the employee's bargaining representative (union).</li>
               <li>The unit administrator may extend the probation of a non-bargained-for employee up to six months by notifying the employee in writing prior to completion of the original probationary period.</li>
               <li>An employee whose position is reclassified is not subject to a trial or probationary period.</li>
               <li>During probationary or trial periods, the supervisor should have regular discussions regarding performance with the employee. Problems should be addressed in clear and precise terms, documented, and the consequences of unimproved performance should be spelled out.</li>
               <li>When an employee makes a percent change during his/her probationary period, the employee will complete the remaining hours minus the time already worked. Example: A half-time CT employee goes to full-time status after having worked 300 hours. The 300 hours worked would be deducted from the full-time probationary period of 1040 hours, leaving the employee with 740 hours to complete his/her probationary period.</li>

         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>CTU:</strong> Full-time employees shall serve a probationary period of 1040 hours of actual work commencing at the time of hire as a new employee with the University or entry into the bargaining unit from other University employment. Three-quarter time employees shall serve a probationary period of 780 hours of actual work, and half-time employees 520 hours of actual work.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>1585, 324, 999:</strong> Employees shall serve a probationary period of 1040 hours of actual work upon entry into the bargaining unit (<strong>VARIES:</strong> 1585 and 324 part-time employees serve a probationary period of 520 hours of actual work upon entry into the bargaining unit).</p>

         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>APSA and Nurses</strong>: The trial period is the first six months in a new classification within the same employee group.</p>
         <p xmlns="">

         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Trial period clarification for a CTU employee:</strong> An employee reassigned within a department to another position at the same grade level and classification does not undergo a trial period. An employee entering a position that has been posted, even though it's in the same department and is at the same grade level and classification, does need to complete a trial period consisting of 256 working hours. A CTU employee bypassed due to a reduction in hours serves a 256-hour trial period in the new position. Prior to the expiration of 256 hours, the employer may terminate the trial period.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>All others: </strong>The first 520 actual hours worked.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>Specific <a title="Union Contracts" href="/contracts/index.html">Collective Bargaining Agreements</a> should be consulted for details regarding probationary and trial periods (see Policy and Procedure for filling vacant positions - regular).</p>
