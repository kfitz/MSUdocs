            <span>The following policy was created on October 1, 2012. <br/>

         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> Regular, Temporary, and On-Call Support Staff Applicants and Employees</p>
         <p xmlns="">Michigan State University is committed to providing a safe environment for its students, faculty, and staff in support of its educational mission. This Policy is intended to help the University achieve that goal by mandating the use of criminal background checks in the hiring process for regular, temporary and on-call support staff employees and by establishing procedures for conducting those background checks.</p>
         <p xmlns="">A criminal background check is required for all new regular staff, and new or rehired temporary and on-call support staff.<sup> [1] </sup>The criminal background check will include the following:<sup> [2]</sup>
         </p>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>Verification of Social Security Number</li>
            <li>Examination of county criminal records (county of current residence)</li>
            <li>Examination of state criminal records (up to 10 years)</li>
            <li>Examination of sex offender registry (nationwide)</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 xmlns="" class="subheadtext">Procedure</h3>
         <div xmlns="">Applicants/Department:</div>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>Applicants will be informed that a criminal background check is a prerequisite to any regular, temporary and on-call support staff position at MSU.</li>
            <li>The final applicant for a regular, temporary or on-call position will be required to complete a consumer disclosure and authorization form for a criminal background check to be conducted by an outside vendor for review by MSU Human Resources. The applicant’s refusal or failure to submit the authorization form within the specified timelines will constitute a withdrawal from the applicant pool.</li>
         </ul>
         <p xmlns="">MSU Human Resources:</p>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>MSU Human Resources will initiate the criminal background check once a contingent offer of employment has been made and an authorization form is completed. Written offers of employment must clearly state that the offer is contingent on satisfactory criminal background check results.</li>
         </ul>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>The results of the criminal background check will be received and reviewed by MSU Human Resources. If questionable results are obtained, MSU Human Resources will contact the applicant and provide an opportunity for the applicant to explain the results and provide clarifying information. Prior criminal convictions do not automatically preclude employment</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <li>MSU Human Resources may consult with the hiring department to evaluate the relevancy of the applicant’s criminal history to the position the candidate is seeking. MSU Human Resources may also seek advice and guidance from other University offices, such as the MSU Police Department and Office of the General Counsel.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
               <li>The assessment of a candidate’s criminal history will take into account:
<ul>
                     <li>The nature and gravity of any criminal offense(s);</li>
                     <li>The individual’s age at the time of the offense(s);</li>
                     <li>The number and type of offense (felony, misdemeanor, traffic violations, etc.);</li>
                     <li>The sentence or sanction for the offense and compliance with the sanction(s);</li>
                     <li>The amount of time that has passed since the offense and/or completion of the sentence(s);</li>
                     <li>Whether there is a pattern of offenses;</li>
                     <li>Whether the offense arose in connection with the applicant’s prior employment;</li>
                     <li>Information supplied by the applicant about the offense(s);</li>
                     <li>Work record and references after the offense(s);</li>
                     <li>Subsequent criminal activity; and</li>
                     <li>Truthfulness of the applicant in disclosing the offense(s).</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>The University may decline to hire any applicant whose criminal history the University deems incompatible with the position the applicant is seeking.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Regular, temporary and on-call applicants may not begin working until the required background check has been performed and the results received and assessed by MSU Human Resources.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>In order to provide the maximum degree of protection for applicants’ privacy, all records related to criminal background checks will be maintained in a secure location separate from employee personnel records. Criminal background check records will be maintained on a confidential basis to the maximum extent allowed by law.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>Any candidate who provides false or misleading information will be eliminated from further consideration. If false or misleading information is discovered after an individual has been hired, this shall be regarded as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.</li>
         </ul>

            <div>
               <p>
                  <sup> [1]</sup> The University will rely on the background check conducted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in lieu of a University background check for individuals coming to the University directly from residence outside the United States.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>
                  <sup>[2 ]</sup> Nothing in this Policy negates the possibility that a more comprehensive criminal background check may be required pursuant to state or federal law or for certain sensitive positions (such as those with significant financial responsibilities) or that a criminal background check may be required for existing support staff who: (1) are legally required to have a background check, (2) are required to have a criminal background check pursuant to the Conducting Youth Programs on Campus: Minimum Operational Requirements, (3) work in facilities that require a criminal background check, or (4) are assigned new duties that involve significant safety or security considerations or financial responsibilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <sup>[3 ]</sup>Costs associated with the criminal background check process will be covered centrally.</p>
