         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Summary of benefit:</strong> Course Fee Courtesy consists of credit of an amount equal to one-half of the applicable Michigan resident on-campus undergraduate course fees at Michigan State University. This reduction in tuition is not applicable while enrolled at any other institution.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Course fees shall be defined as the amount associated with credit hour enrollment and shall not include the registration fee or such fees, taxes and charges as may be collected for third parties.</li>
Only one Course Fee Courtesy Application needs to be completed for the entire undergraduate degree (120 credits attempted unless the student leaves the University and readmission as a student is required). Applications should be submitted online to Human Resources in accordance with the following deadlines:
<ul>
                  <li>Fall semester - June 1</li>
                  <li>Spring semester - October 1</li>
