         <div xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> Regular University support staff working half-time or more</div>
         <p xmlns="">Employees who are called to serve on jury duty will be compensated for the difference between pay received from the court and straight-time base pay. The employee may retain any payment for mileage.</p>
         <p xmlns="">APA, CTU, APSA, 999 and 1585 employees who are called to testify pursuant to court-issued subpoenas will receive jury duty pay in that event also (see appropriate <a title="Union Contracts" href="/contracts/index.html">Collective Bargaining Agreement</a>).</p>
         <p xmlns="">The University recognizes the civic responsibility of employees to serve on jury duty and makes provision for eligible employees to perform such duty without loss of pay.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Usage requirements and approvals:</strong> The employee must notify his/her supervisor of the call to jury duty as soon as the information is known.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The employee must provide proof of the call to jury duty. Proof of jury duty pay must be submitted to the supervisor if absent for more than 80 continuous hours per jury duty assignment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The employee is expected to report for regular University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at court.</p>
         <p xmlns="">When called to testify, the employee must provide proof of subpoena and proof of witness fee, or proof that no witness fee was provided.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Amount of payment:</strong> For each work day of full or partial absence due to jury duty beyond 80 hours per jury duty assignment, and provided the employee returns to regular University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at court, the employee will receive the difference in pay between: pay received from the court (or witness fees) and regular straight time base pay, excluding shift premium or other premium payment, for the hours absent from work.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Coordination with other types of pay or benefits: </strong>If the employee is otherwise eligible for holiday pay, holiday pay may be given if jury duty is interrupted by a legal holiday recognized by the University (see <a title="Holiday Pay"
               href="/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/holiday_pay.html">Policy and Procedure for Holiday Pay</a>).</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Full-time/part-time status considerations: </strong>Part-time employees will be paid the difference in pay only for the hours scheduled to work but not worked because of the jury duty.</p>
