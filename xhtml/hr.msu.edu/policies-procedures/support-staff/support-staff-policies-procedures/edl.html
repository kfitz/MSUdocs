         <p xmlns="">The University provides an interim income protection plan for eligible employees expected to receive Long-Term Disability benefits.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Eligibility: </strong>Regular full-time University support staff</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Effective date of benefit:</strong> After completion of 60 continuous full-time equivalent (FTE) service months.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Summary of benefits:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>The benefit provides full base wage/salary in cases expected to result in total disability, as defined in the Long-Term Disability Master Contract, for a period of up to 180 days from the employee's last day of active work.</li>
               <li>The benefit commences upon the expiration of all accrued sick, vacation, and personal leave.</li>
               <li>Determination of whether a case is expected to result in total disability may be made by the University Physician based on information received from the employee's physician and other medical reports.</li>
               <li>Lack of conclusive medical evidence may delay approval of the Extended Disability Leave (EDL) benefit, until Long-Term Disability benefits are approved. If so, payments will be made on a retroactive basis. In these cases, it is necessary for the employee to maintain benefit premium payments. Reimbursement for the amount of University contributions will be made upon approval of the EDL.</li>
               <li>Employees expected to return to work within 180 days do not qualify for this benefit.</li>
               <li>Authorization to pay EDL benefits is made by MSU Human Resources Workers' Compensation/Long-Term Disability.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
