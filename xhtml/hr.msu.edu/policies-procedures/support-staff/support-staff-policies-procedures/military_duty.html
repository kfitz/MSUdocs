         <div xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to:</strong> Regular University support staff working half-time or more</div>
         <p xmlns="">The University recognizes the value of the military reserve and makes provision for eligible employees to attend short-term military duty without loss of pay.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The University will pay the difference between the employee's military pay and base pay, if the employee's military pay is less, for up to fifteen calendar days when ordered to active duty for training, and for up to ten additional calendar days per fiscal year when ordered to active duty for the purpose of handling civil disorders.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Usage requirements and approval:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>The employee must notify his/her supervisor of the call to military duty as soon as the information is known.</li>
               <li>The employee must provide proof of the call to military duty and proof of military duty.</li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Amount of pay:</strong> For each full workday of absence, the employee will receive the difference in pay between:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>regular military pay less any amounts specifically received for meals, housing, or travel, and</li>
               <li>eight hours regular pay at the base rate of pay excluding shift premium or other premium payment.</li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Coordination with other types of pay or benefits:</strong> An employee may use accrued vacation time in addition to receiving military duty pay. (The employee will continue to accrue vacation and sick time at his/her normal rate. The longevity date will not be affected.)</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Full-time/part-time status considerations:</strong> Part-time employees will be paid the difference in pay between the total military duty pay received and the employee's base pay for the total hours scheduled to work but not worked because of the military duty, if the military duty pay is less.</p>
