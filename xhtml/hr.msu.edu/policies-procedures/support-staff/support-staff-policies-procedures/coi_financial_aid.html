                  <strong>Conflict of Interest</strong>: A conflict of interest exists when an employee's financial interests or other opportunities for personal benefit may compromise, or reasonably appear to compromise, the independence of judgment with which the employee performs his/her responsibilities at the University.</li>

The University will not refuse to certify, or delay certification of, any federal loan based on the borrower's selection or a particular lender or guaranty agency.<br/>
                  <br/>When participating in the Federal Direct Loan Program, the University may assign a first-time borrower's federal loan to the Federal Government as the lender.<br/>
                  <br/>Under no circumstances will the University assign a student's private student loan to a particular lender, or refuse to certify or delay certification of any private loan, based upon the borrower's selection of lender or guaranty agency.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Private Loans</strong>:  The University will not request or accept from any lender any offer of funds to be used for private education loans<sup>[2]</sup> , including funds for an opportunity pool loan, to students in exchange for the University providing concessions or promises regarding providing the lender with (i) a specified number of federal loans; (ii) a specified federal loan volume; or (iii) a preferred lender arrangement for federal loans.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Co-Branding:</strong> The University will not permit a private educational lender<sup>[3]</sup> to use the University's name, emblem, mascot, logo, or any other words, pictures, or symbols associated with the University to imply endorsement of private educational loans by that lender.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Staffing Assistance:</strong> The University will not request or accept from any lender any assistance with call center staffing or financial aid office staffing. Nothing in this section, however, prevents the University from accepting assistance from a lender related to (i) professional development training for its staff; (ii) providing educational counseling materials, financial literacy materials, or debt management materials to borrowers, provided that such materials disclose to borrowers the identification of any lender that assisted in preparing or providing such materials; or (iii) staffing services on a short-term, non-recurring basis to assist the University with financial aid-related functions during emergencies, including State-declared or federally declared natural disasters, federally declared national disasters, and other localized disasters and emergencies identified by the Secretary of Education.</li>

               <li>
                  <strong>Reimbursement of Expenses</strong>:  Expenses incurred while attending professional association meetings, conferences, or in connection with service on an advisory board, commission, or group described in Section V.D. of this Policy must be paid by the University.<sup>[5] </sup>Entertainment expenses such as concert or sports tickets or greens fees may not be accepted. Employees are expected to personally pay for such expenses or request reimbursement from the University in accordance with University policy.</li>
               <li>Meals:  Employees may occasionally need to share meals with employees of lenders, guaranty agencies, the State of Michigan, or other colleges or universities in the course of business.
