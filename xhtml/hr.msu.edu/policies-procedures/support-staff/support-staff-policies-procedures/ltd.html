            <strong>Summary of benefits:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>The benefit is payable to employees who become disabled as defined in the LTD Master Contract (available at MSU Human Resources) and are unable to work due to sickness or bodily injury. Disability or disabled is either: (1)(a) for the first 30 months* of disability, being completely unable due to sickness, bodily injury, or pregnancy to perform the material and substantial duties of your normal occupation and not performing any other occupation; and (b) after the first 30 months, being unable due to sickness, bodily injury, or pregnancy to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which you are reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience; or (2) after you have been continuously disabled as defined in (1) above for at least 180 days, working but due to continuation of the same disability, being unable to earn more than 80% of your increasing monthly wage base. You must be under the regular care of a physician, other than yourself or a member of your family. *If benefits cease due to termination of disability, a new 30-month period will not begin for a disability that: (1) begins within 12 consecutive months of the end of the prior disability; and (2) is due to the same sickness, bodily injury or pregnancy.</li>
               <li>Benefits normally begin on the 181st day following the completion of 180 days of continuous disability. If total disability starts before age 60, benefits continue until age 65, recovery or death, whichever occurs first. If total disability starts on or after age 60 but less than 65, benefits are paid for 4 1/2 years, until recovery or death whichever occurs first. If disability occurs after age 65 but less than 69, benefits continue to age 70, recovery or death, whichever occurs first. If total disability starts at age 69 or over, benefits continue for one year, recovery or death, whichever occurs first.</li>
               <li>The Extended Disability Leave benefit may be payable for 180 days from the employee's last day worked (see <a title="Extended Disability Leave"
                     href="/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/edl.html">Policy and Procedure for Extended Disability Leave</a>).</li>
               <li>The monthly income benefit is 60% of monthly base salary up to $15,000.
<ul>
                     <li>Initial LTD benefit amount is offset by any Social Security, Workers' Compensation or other applicable wage replacement benefits. All employee groups are eligible to receive a monthly $50 minimum LTD benefit even if Workers' Compensation, Social Security and/or other applicable wage replacement benefit offsets equal the employee's monthly income benefit amount.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>The monthly waiver benefit will pay both the employee's 5% and the University's 10% contribution to the Base Retirement Plan of the employee. This is in addition to the monthly LTD income benefit.</li>
               <li>Both the monthly income benefit and the monthly waiver benefit are increased each year.</li>
               <li>In addition, the employee will receive the University contribution toward health, dental, and Employee-Paid Life benefits. The dependent option of the Employee-Paid Life Plan is continued when disability payments begin. If the employee is not enrolled in the lowest cost health plan, he/she will be billed for the additional portion of the premium cost.</li>
               <li>The plan administrator makes the final determination of disability entitlement.</li>

               <li>Employees on an unpaid leave of absence continue to be covered up to 24 months if they engage in active work in the field of education or research; otherwise the coverage ceases on the last day of active work. For flex appointees, see <a title="Flexible Appointments"

               <li>When an employee's LTD benefits cease, the University-contribution toward health care and dental benefits will continue if the employee accrued 25 years of service, or 15 years of service and age 62 before the end of his/her leave of absence (usually the first two years he/she is on LTD). Once an employee's leave ends, the employee does not accrue years of service toward retirement.</li>
               <li>If an employee does not meet the above requirements, the employee is entitled to either <a title="COBRA" href="/benefits/cobra/index.html">COBRA</a> benefits or cash for life benefits(the chart below clarifies which benefits an employee is eligible for, depending on years of service with the University).</li>
               <li>If an employee dies while receiving LTD benefits, his/her eligible dependents are entitled to <a title="COBRA" href="/benefits/cobra/index.html">COBRA</a> or cash for life survivor benefits. Benefit eligibility is outlined in the following chart:</li>
