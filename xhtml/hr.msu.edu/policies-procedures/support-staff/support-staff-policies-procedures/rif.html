         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Applies to: </strong>All employees unless abridged by <a title="Union Contracts" href="/contracts/index.html">Collective Bargaining Agreements</a>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">It is the policy of the University to endeavor to provide continuing employment. Reduction in the work force which may be necessary due to lack of funds, lack of work or other reasons will be accomplished through normal attrition whenever possible.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In addition to normal attrition, layoff due to lack of work and/or funds will be utilized as deemed necessary by the University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">An employee who is subject to layoff or who has been laid off shall be afforded a reasonable number of interviews for any position at the same or lower levels if MSU Human Resources deems the employee is qualified.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Eligibility for layoff and recall:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Must be a regular employee without "off-date" designation (see <a title="Employment Status"
                     href="/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/emp_status.html">Policy and Procedure for Employment Status</a>).</li>
               <li>Must be scheduled to work half-time or more.</li>
               <li>Must have completed a probationary period.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Definitions:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Layoff - the severance of an employee from the payroll due to lack of funds and/or lack of work, with eligibility for recall. To be eligible, the employee must satisfy eligibility requirements.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Recall - the reinstatement of a laid-off employee to active status within a period which is the lesser of the employee's length of service before layoff or 2 years. In the event of recall the employee will retain the original service date but does not receive service credits for the period of layoff. Accrued sick leave will be reinstated when the recalled employee returns to work (<strong>VARIES</strong> for APA and APSA).</p>
         <p xmlns="">Termination - the severance of an employee from the payroll without eligibility for recall.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Order of layoff: </strong>Due to the nature of the work performed, the ability of the employee to fulfill the requirements of the work remaining shall be the prime factor in determining who in the department is to be laid off.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Where ability to perform the work remaining is equal, the University will follow these priorities for reduction in force as much as practicable:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>temporary before permanent,</li>
               <li>probationary before non-probationary, and</li>
               <li>employees with short service before employees with long service.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Recall:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Employees with the greatest length of service will be recalled first, provided they can perform the duties of the position.</li>
               <li>Employees recalled from layoff may be eligible to receive specified pay adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Continuation of optional benefits: </strong>Optional benefits may be continued by employees on layoff status by direct payment to MSU Human Resources for the duration of the layoff.<br/>
            <br/>For APSA, APA, CTU, 1585, 274, FOP and NURSES, the employer will make its regular contribution toward the cost of the health care coverage premium through the end of the month of layoff.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Termination:</strong>
         </p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>An employee on layoff status will lose all recall rights and be terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following:
<ul>
                     <li>refusal to be available for interview,</li>
                     <li>refusal to accept a position offered if the salary offered is equivalent to 80% or more of the employee's salary before layoff, or</li>
                     <li>expiration of the recall eligibility period.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Layoff status and attendant recall rights are also terminated should the employee accept other regular employment with the University.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>

               <li>Reduction in force should be avoided when possible by using alternative methods including:

               </li>
               <li>Layoff notices may not be given to employees while on leave of absence.</li>
               <li>Source of funding is not a criteria for determining which employee is to be laid off except for employees who have been designated as project technicians or off-date employees.</li>
               <li>When an employee on layoff or leave of absence (including illness and/or disability leaves due to Workers' Compensation) accepts a work assignment (half-time or greater), the original ending date of the leave may be extended by the number of days employed.
