         <p xmlns="">Once an employee meets the minimum retirement requirements and becomes an official MSU retiree upon cessation of active service (please see <a title="Retiring from the University Policy"
               href="/policies-procedures/support-staff/support-staff-policies-procedures/retirement.html"
               target="_blank">Retiring from the University Policy</a>), an official retiree qualifies for certain benefits:</p>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>Retirement income is paid by the 403(b) Base Retirement Program, 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program, 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan and/or UNCRP plans as described in the plan documents, policies or other documentation for those programs, and as elected by the retiree.</li>
            <li>Depending on your Retirement Calculation Date (sometimes referred to as the Retirement Eligibility Date in the HR Payroll system), which often is your hire date but may be a later date based on your circumstances, group health care and dental coverage may be maintained for eligible retirees, with a University contribution based on the full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at the time of retirement. When an individual is actively employed, the University contribution level is determined based on employment percentage, i.e. an employee is considered half-time if they work 50 - 64.9%; three-quarter time if they work 65-89.9%; full-time if they work 90-100%. In retirement, the contribution level is based on accrued FTE service months. The charts below indicate the number of FTE service months required to receive the various University contribution levels.</li>
            <li>Support staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on or after July 1, 2002 and prior to July 1, 2010, who subsequently meets the minimum retirement requirements will receive a University contribution toward health care and dental coverage for the retiree only. The retiree may pay the applicable premium to cover eligible dependents.</li>
            <li>For faculty and academic staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on or after July 1, 2005 and prior to July 1, 2010, the University will contribute* to the lowest cost health plan's single rate for which the employee/retiree is eligible. At retirement, the employee must designate whether the employee receives the University contribution or whether the contribution is to be split 50/50 between the employee and his/her spouse. This designation is irrevocable regardless of circumstance, including returning to work or death. The designation of the 50/50 contribution is also non-transferable to future spouses. Dental coverage may be maintained for eligible retirees, with a University contribution based on the full-time equivalent FTE service months at the time of retirement.</li>
            <li>For faculty, academic staff and support staff with a Retirement Calculation Date on or after July 1, 2010, who subsequently meets the minimum retirement requirements may elect to continue health care and dental coverage for the retiree, spouse and eligible dependents by paying the applicable premiums.</li>

            <li>Retiring University support staff may be eligible for a payoff of unused vacation time, personal leave, sick leave and a prorated longevity payment in the year of retirement, as described in the polices for those programs, or applicable <a title="Contracts" href="/contracts/index.html" target="_blank">collective bargaining agreements</a>.
