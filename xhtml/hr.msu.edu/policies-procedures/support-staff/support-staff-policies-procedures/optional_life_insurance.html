         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Premium contribution:</strong> The program is funded entirely from employee premiums and rates are subject to future group experience. The employee's monthly contributions are described in the chart above.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Application for enrollment: </strong>
            <br/>Employees should enroll within 30 days of initial employment or appointment to an eligible status. If not previously enrolled in the dependent option, newly acquired dependents may be added within 30 days of their becoming eligible dependents or during an annual open enrollment period. Only one dependent option is required for all dependents current and born thereafter.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Enrollment/Change form and Beneficiary Designation form are available from MSU Human Resources.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Employees who request to increase their life insurance coverage by one level or more, during the annual open enrollment period, will be required to complete an evidence of insurability. The University's annual open enrollment period is in the Fall (usually for the month of October) and coverage changes become effective January 1.</p>
         <p xmlns="">A new hire must elect coverage within 30 days or an evidence of insurability is required. An evidence of insurability is also required, of a new hire, if they elect an amount greater than the lesser of 3 times their base annual earnings or $500,000.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>Employees not actively at work on that day will become covered on the day they return to work.</li>

               <li>Coverage will terminate on the date an employee becomes an official retiree, if age 70 or older.</li>
               <li>Employees on an unpaid leave of absence who wish to maintain coverage will be billed and must forward the full premium payment to MSU Human Resources. Coverage allowed to lapse due to non-payment of premiums will automatically be reinstated to the coverage in effect prior to the leave. (Employee must return to an eligible status.)</li>
               <li>Dependent coverage terminates upon the earliest of an employee's:
