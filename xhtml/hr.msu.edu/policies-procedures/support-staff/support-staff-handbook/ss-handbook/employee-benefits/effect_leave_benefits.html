            <strong>With Pay:</strong> During a leave of absence with pay or approved Family Medical Leave Act leave, employee contributions for optional benefit programs will continue to be deducted and the University will continue its regular contributions toward health plan coverage and the Base Retirement Program. Dental and Long-Term Disability coverage remains in force for those enrolled and eligible immediately prior to the leave.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Without Pay:</strong> Employees granted approved leave of absence without pay:</p>
         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>May continue the health, dental, Optional Employee-Paid Life, and Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment programs by paying the full cost of the applicable premium. If coverages are not maintained, the employee may re-enroll within 31 days of returning to active employment or during the annual open enrollment.</li>
            <li>Individuals enrolled in the health plan waiver receive a prorated payment in July based on the number of months worked during the fiscal year (July 1-June 30).</li>
            <li>Employee contributions to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) are suspended during the leave and may restart upon return from leave. FSA claims incurred during the leave may be submitted upon return from leave.</li>
