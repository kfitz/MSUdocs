            <strong>Retirement Plans</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">MSU provides two different retirement plans: the MSU 403(b) Retirement Plan and the MSU 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan.</p>
         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>MSU 403(b) Retirement Plan</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">Michigan State University sponsors a tax-deferred defined contribution plan operated under section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The MSU 403(b) Retirement Plan consists of two different programs: the MSU 403(b) Base Retirement Program (BRP) and the MSU 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Program (SRP).</p>
         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>MSU 403(b) Base Retirement Program (BRP)</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Participation is dependent upon length of service and is mandatory for many employees, based on the collective bargaining agreements.

         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>Coverage:</strong> Upon termination or retirement, the program can provide an income based on the total amount accumulated from the employee’s and the University’s contributions, and the earnings on those accounts.</p>
         <p xmlns="" style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> For eligible employees, the MSU 403(b) Base Retirement Program consists of a 5 percent contribution from the employee’s base wage/salary and a University contribution of 10 percent of base wage/salary.
