            <strong>Educational Assistance</strong>

            <strong>Eligibility</strong>: Regular full-time (90-100 percent) and part-time (50% or more) employees who meet program provisions as provided in collective bargaining agreements may take advantage of this benefit. General eligibility criteria include the required number of full-time equivalent (FTE) service months, and admission into a degree program or job-related course. Whether release time is given during working hours is dependent upon specific collective bargaining agreements and approval by the department administrator/supervisor. This benefit also covers non-credit courses.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Coverage</strong>: The amount of tuition waiver or reimbursement for courses will be based on a percentage of the MSU regular prevailing tuition rate per credit. The number of eligible courses and credit hours may differ by employee group in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreements. Reimbursement for noncredit courses is also available.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Tuition waiver for a percentage of MSU credit courses is available to most employee groups as provided by the separate collective bargaining agreements.</p>
         <p xmlns="">A grade of 2.0 or higher is required for credit courses to be covered by the benefit. The employee must provide evidence that he/she has successfully completed a course. When MSU tuition waiver has been requested, the employee will authorize release of record of MSU course work, grades, and specific tuition awards to the Human Resource Development office on the tuition benefit application.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Employees eligible for other financial aid will be covered only for that portion of the tuition fee that exceeds the amount of those benefits.</p>
