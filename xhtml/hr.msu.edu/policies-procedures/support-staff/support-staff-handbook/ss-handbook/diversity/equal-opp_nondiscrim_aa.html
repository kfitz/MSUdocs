The MSU Anti-Discrimination Policy prohibits acts of discrimination and harassment on the basis of age, color, gender, gender identity, disability status, height, marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status or weight. The University is also guided by the following federal and state civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the following areas:</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Race, Color, Religion, Sex, National Origin:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, protects applicants and employees from discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment, on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), or national origin. Religious discrimination includes failing to reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious practices where the accommodation does not impose undue hardship. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Executive Order 11246 prohibits job discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or national origin, and requires affirmative action to ensure equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Disability:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Title I and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, protect qualified individuals from discrimination on the basis of disability in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment. Disability discrimination includes not making reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, barring undue hardship. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in admission, employment, treatment, or access in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act of 1976 provides individuals the opportunity to obtain employment, housing, and full and equal utilization of public accommodations, public services, and educational facilities without discrimination because of a disability.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Age:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, protects applicants and employees 40 years of age or older from discrimination based on age in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment. The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination based on age in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Sex:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">In addition to sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, prohibits sex discrimination in the payment of wages to women and men performing substantially equal work, in jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, under similar working conditions, in the same establishment. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on gender in education programs or activities. Protection is extended to include employment and admissions at institutions that receive federal financial assistance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Genetic Information:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (“GINA”) of 2008 protects applicants and employees from discrimination based on genetic information in hiring, promotion, discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment. GINA also restricts employers’ acquisition of genetic information and strictly limits disclosure of genetic information. Genetic information includes information about genetic tests of applicants, employees, or their family members; the manifestation of diseases or disorders in family members (family medical history); and requests for or receipt of genetic services by applicants, employees, or their family members.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Military Service Members and Veterans:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994, as amended, prohibits discrimination against persons because of their service in the Armed Forces Reserve, the National Guard, or other uniformed services. The act protects the rights of veterans, reservists, National Guard members, and certain other members of the uniformed services to reclaim their civilian employment after being absent due to military service or training. The Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1972 prohibits certain government contractors from discriminating against qualified disabled veterans or Vietnam era veterans. The act also requires contractors to engage in affirmative action to employ and advance veterans in employment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Other:</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Elliott-Larson Civil Rights Act (1976) of the State of Michigan prohibits discrimination practices, policies, and customs, based on religion, race, color, national origin, age, gender, height, weight, familial status, or marital status.</p>
