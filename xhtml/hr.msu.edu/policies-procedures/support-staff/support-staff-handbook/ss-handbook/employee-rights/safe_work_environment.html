         <p xmlns="">The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on October 12, 1990:</p>
         <p xmlns="">Consistent with state and federal law, Michigan State University will maintain a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol are prohibited on any property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of Michigan State University. Pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline, any employee involved in the unlawful use, sale, manufacturing, dispensing, or possession of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol on University premises or work sites, or working under the influence of such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution. The employee must notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) calendar days after such conviction. Failure to provide such notice will subject the employee to discipline up to and including dismissal pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline. The employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, who will report the incident to the Office of Human Resources, Academic Human Resources, or Student Employment Office.</p>

            <strong>Smoke-Free Policy</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 16, 1993:</p>
         <p xmlns="">Compelling scientific finds … indicate that the simple separation of buildings into “smoking” and “nonsmoking” sections does not eliminate the unequivocal health risks that result from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In light of these findings, Michigan State University is committed to eliminating harmful exposures to environmental tobacco smoke unwanted by students, faculty, staff, and visitors and adopts the following smoke-free policy.</p>
         <ol xmlns="">
            <li>Smoking will not be permitted in any closed space, regardless of location, except specifically designated private residential space and hotel rooms. Smoking is permitted outside of buildings and should be 25 feet away from exits and entrances, unless otherwise designated.</li>
            <li>Cigarettes and other tobacco products will not be sold on University grounds.</li>
            <li>This smoke-free policy applies to all MSU facilities and vehicles, owned or leased.</li>
         </ol>
         <p xmlns="">Questions, problems, and complaints regarding this policy should be handled through existing departmental administrative channels and administrative procedures, including the Housing Options Committee. Persons found to have violated this policy will be subject to disciplinary actions in the same manner and magnitude as violations of other University policies.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The success of this policy will depend on the thoughtfulness, consideration, and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers. All employees share in the responsibility for adhering to and enforcing this policy.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Smoking cessation programs and materials are available through <a title="Health4U website"

         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 applies to MSU and all of its employees, including student employees. Consistent with state and federal law, Michigan State University maintains a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance. Such behavior is prohibited on any property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of Michigan State University. These prohibitions also apply to employees performing safety sensitive functions and whose position responsibilities require they obtain a commercial driver’s license.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Employees who violate University policy prohibiting the use or possession of illegal drugs are subject to disciplinary action through the appropriate disciplinary process.

            <strong>Medical Marijuana Act</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the “Act”) became Michigan law on December 4, 2008. The Act permits an individual with a qualifying debilitating medical condition to register as a medical marijuana patient with the Michigan Department of Community Health (“MDCH”) and avoid criminal penalties under state law for certain medical uses of marijuana. Information about the Act and the state registry program is available on the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mmp" target="_blank">MDCH</a> website.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In order to meet its obligations under federal law to maintain a drug free workplace, University policy regarding marijuana remains the same. Employees may not use or possess marijuana on any University property or in the course of employment. University policy also prohibits employees from reporting to work under the influence of a controlled substance, such as marijuana. This is true whether the marijuana is smoked or ingested through other means. For additional information regarding the <a title="Support Staff Drug and Alcohol Policy"
