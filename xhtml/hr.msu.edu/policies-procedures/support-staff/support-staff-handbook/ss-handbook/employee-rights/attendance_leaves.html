            <strong>Absences</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Employees are expected to maintain good attendance. When absent from work due to unavoidable circumstances, an employee must make a good faith effort to immediately notify his/her supervisor of the reason. If the absence is to continue beyond the first day, the employee must notify his/her supervisor on a daily basis unless otherwise arranged. Absence for three consecutive workdays without notifying the supervisor is considered a voluntary termination.</p>
         <p xmlns="">All absences must be charged to personal leave, accrued vacation, or sick leave, whichever is appropriate. When no accrued time is available, unpaid leave of up to 10 days per fiscal year may be approved by the supervisor. The lost wages will be reflected in the employee’s paycheck. Absences exceeding 10 consecutive days must be approved as a leave of absence by Human Resources.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Absences due to inclement weather or declared state of emergency will require the use of either personal leave or vacation time. For more information regarding absences, click <a title="Absences"

            <strong>Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Staff employed at the University for a total of 12 months (may have been intermittent employment) and having at least 1,250 work hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of FMLA leave. The Department of Labor (DOL) has revised this regulation to provide that a service break of seven years or more need not be counted in determining whether an employee has been employed for at least 12 months.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The 1,250 hours requirement is counted only for hours actually worked and does not count hours spent on vacation, sick, and personal leave, etc. However, under the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), employees called to active (or National Guard) duty are entitled, upon their return to employment, to all the benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they had been continuously employed.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a federal law enacted to help employees balance their work and family life and to promote the stability and economic security of families. It allows eligible employees to take job-protected unpaid leave, or substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks during a 12- month period (July 1 - June 30) for a family or personal serious health condition which qualifies under FMLA.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The FMLA also provides leave for service members and their families under certain circumstances.</p>
         <p xmlns="">On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (H.R. 2647). In section 565, the legislation makes important changes to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).</p>
         <p xmlns="">Specifically, military caregiver leave has been expanded so it may be used to care for veterans undergoing treatment, recuperation or therapy for an injury, as long as the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves within five years of requiring care. The amendments also expand military caregiver leave so that employees may use it to care for a covered service member's serious injury or illness incurred because service on active duty aggravated an existing or preexisting injuries. Previously, the act only allowed caregiver leave for serious illnesses or injuries incurred on active duty.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The legislation also expands the use of qualifying exigency leave. Under the new law, qualifying exigency leave will now cover family members of the regular Armed Forces deployed to a foreign country, in addition to current coverage of family members of the Guard or Reserves.</p>

The University will compensate the employee called to jury duty, or as a subpoenaed witness, based on straight time base pay for up to 80 consecutive hours. After 80 hours, the employee will receive the difference between base pay and jury pay. The employee’s benefits will continue. The employee must notify his/her supervisor of the call to jury duty as soon as it is received and must provide proof of jury duty attendance.
