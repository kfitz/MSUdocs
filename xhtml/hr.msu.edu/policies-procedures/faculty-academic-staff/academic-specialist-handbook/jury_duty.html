         <p xmlns="">Academic specialists serving on jury duty who are absent from work for 80 continuous hours or less will receive their regular pay and are not required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the University. They must, however, notify the department chairperson/school director of the call to jury duty as soon as it is received.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Academic specialists serving on jury duty who are absent from work for more than 80 continuous hours must notify the department chairperson/school director of the call to jury duty as soon as it is received and are required to submit proof of jury duty payment to the Payroll Office. The academic specialist will receive the difference between the pay received from the court and normal base pay.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In all cases, the academic specialist is expected to report for regular University duty when temporarily excused from attendance at court.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Full cooperation is expected between the academic specialist, unit administrator and department(s) involved to insure minimal disruption in the instructional and service responsibilities of the unit.<br/>
