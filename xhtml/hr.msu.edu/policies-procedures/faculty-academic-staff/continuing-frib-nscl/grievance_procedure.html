            <strong>9.1.</strong> Any CA staff member may initiate a grievance alleging a violation of existing policies or established practices by laboratory management other than the Director. Grievances against the Laboratory Director shall follow the University's Faculty Grievance Policy. Before filing a grievance, the CA staff member must discuss his/her complaint with appropriate Laboratory administrators in an attempt to resolve the complaint informally.</div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>9.2.</strong> If the CA staff member's complaint is not satisfactorily resolved after informal discussion with the appropriate administrator, the CA staff member may initiate the grievance procedure by submitting a written statement of the grievance to their Department Head within 30 calendar days of first knowledge of the alleged violation. If the Department Head is the administrator whose actions are at issue, the Director will decide who hears the grievance. The grievance statement shall set forth the alleged violation of existing policy or established practices, a concise statement of the facts relevant to the grievance, the name of the administrator whose action is at issue, the approximate date on which the alleged action took place, and the redress sought. Within 30 calendar days of filing the grievance statement, both parties to the grievance shall have an opportunity to meet with the Department Head or designate and present relevant information and/or witnesses on their behalf. The Department Head or designate may seek additional information from anyone who has information relevant to the grievance. The Department Head or designate will provide the parties with a written decision indicating his/her findings within 30 calendar days from hearing the grievance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>9.3.</strong> Either party may appeal the decision of the Department Head to the Director of the Laboratory within 20 calendar days of receiving the Department Head's written decision. Within 14 calendar days of receiving the appeal, the Director shall be provided with a statement of the grievance, any testimony or evidence provided by the parties in the initial Hearing, and a copy of the Department Head's response to the grievance. In considering the appeal, the Director may receive additional testimony or evidence, either oral or written, from the parties to the grievance or from other staff and faculty who may provide information. The Director will issue a written decision and recommendations within 20 calendar days of hearing the appeal. Either party may appeal the decision of the Director to the Provost or designee within 20 calendar days of the written decision. The appeal must allege that there has been a prejudicial violation of the grievance procedures or that the decision of the Director of the Laboratory is not consistent with the preponderance of the evidence presented during the appeal. The Provost or designee shall be provided with a statement of the appeal, any written statements or evidence provided by the parties, and a copy of the decisions of the Department Head and Director. The Provost or designee shall issue a final decision on the appeal within 20 calendar days.<br/>
