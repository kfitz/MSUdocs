            <strong>12.1.</strong> The Laboratory encourages the professional development of its staff. CA staff members are encouraged to take advantage of special conferences, seminars, colloquia, and other short-term activities and programs that will enhance their job-related professional knowledge and skills.

As funds for financial assistance are limited, the extent of reimbursement will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</div>
