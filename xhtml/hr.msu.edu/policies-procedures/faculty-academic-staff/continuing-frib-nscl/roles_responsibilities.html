            <strong>1.1 </strong>The CA staff of the Laboratory includes three (3) ranks in each of three (3) areas designated Engineering Staff, Physics Staff, and Research Staff. The specific titles for the nine (9) categories are respectively: l) Engineering staff--Engineer (FRIB/NSCL), Staff Engineer (FRIB/NSCL), and Senior Engineer (FRIB/NSCL); 2) Physics staff-- Physicist (FRIB/NSCL), Staff Physicist (FRIB/NSCL), and Senior Physicist (FRIB/NSCL); and 3) Research Staff --Assistant Professor (FRIB/NSCL), Associate Professor (FRIB/NSCL), and Professor (FRIB/NSCL).
