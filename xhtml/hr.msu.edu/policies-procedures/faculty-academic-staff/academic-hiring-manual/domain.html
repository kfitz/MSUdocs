The affirmative action compliance program for MSUE staff is covered by the United States Department of Agriculture and not the Department of Labor but is consistent with the Academic Hiring Procedures.</li>
                        <li>Postdoctoral Fellow appointments are based on fellowships paid through MSU and the recipients of such fellowships are not employees and so are not covered by the Academic Hiring Procedures.
