            <strong>Colleges of Human Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine<br/>Health Programs Appointment System Salary Program</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">HP faculty salaries are generally made up of two components: base salary, determined with reference to relevant professional markets, plus an additional component derived from funds generated by clinical services. This latter component has been labeled historically as the Health Service Related Component (HSRC). In some cases, base salaries are determined in part by the receipt of contract and grant funds. Base salary and clinical income limits are determined by the relevant department chair(s) with oversight by the relevant dean's office(s). Adjustments in base salaries are determined on a merit basis.</p>
