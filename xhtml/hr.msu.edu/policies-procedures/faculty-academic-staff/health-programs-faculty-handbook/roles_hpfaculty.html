The following sections describe the areas of HP faculty assignments.</p>
         <h3 xmlns="">A. Patient Care Service</h3>
         <p xmlns="">The Health Programs faculty member provides patient care services within owned and/or affiliated University and community facilities and pursuant to University billing procedures. The patient care services provided fall within the scope of practice of the specialty designations recognized by the medical, nursing or professional discipline of the faculty member.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <h3>B. Clinical and Preclinical Teaching</h3>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">The Health Programs faculty member is obligated to provide, coordinate, or assist in giving instruction to students, including undergraduate and graduate nursing students, medical students, residents, post‐doctoral fellows, and practicing professionals in the facilities in which the patient care mission of the medical and nursing colleges is carried out. Teaching responsibilities may be supported on general fund dollars. Such instruction typically includes required or elective clerkships for medical students, clinical supervision for nursing students, supervision and direct instruction for residents and post‐doctoral fellows. Health Programs faculty may also be assigned pre clinical instructional duties (i.e. in college interdepartmental programs, physical examination and interviewing courses, systems courses, etc.). Health Programs faculty may also participate in training programs and continuing medical/nursing education efforts supported and sponsored by the colleges. Evaluation of student progress as an integral piece of the educational process is also included as an HP faculty responsibility.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs faculty are required to comply with the provisions of the Michigan State University Code of Teaching Responsibility, e.g., statement of course objectives, examination policy, office hours, course evaluation, etc.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <h3>C. Scholarly Productivity and Research</h3>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs faculty are expected to be scholarly in the conduct of their responsibilities, whether in teaching, institutional service, or in patient care services.   While acknowledging that the time available to conduct scholarly work will be limited, the conduct of scholarly work that expands the boundaries of knowledge is expected of HP faculty members. The exact type of inquiry should be related to the interests and specialization that the individual holds, thus the research or scholarly work conducted would reflect those abilities and interests (i.e., basic, clinical, quantitative, qualitative). The proportion of the individual's job responsibilities that is to be devoted to scholarly work must be negotiated at the time of hiring and subsequently at each evaluation meeting with regard to reappointment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Evaluation of scholarly productivity and research (for the purposes of reappointment and/or promotion) shall be based on the proportion of an individual's time that is devoted to research and the usual indices of research productivity and quality, i.e., publications, professional presentations, participation in professional organizations, research proposal submissions, etc., and the standards and review guidelines of each department and college.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs faculty are expected to conduct scholarly and research related activities in accordance with the ethical procedures that govern the conduct of science. These include exercising critical self‐discipline and judgment in generating, using, extending, and transmitting knowledge, adhering to the highest standards of intellectual honesty, overseeing and evaluating the research and creative efforts of students and subordinates. Health Programs faculty shall conduct all research and creative activity in a manner consistent with accepted scholarly standards and in conformity with legal, professional, and University codes, policies and regulations which govern research and scholarly endeavors. Applicable University policies are found in the section entitled Research and Creative Endeavors in the Faculty Handbook.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <h3>D. Institutional Services</h3>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs Faculty are obligated to participate in the provision of institutional services at the department and college levels, including committee service, administrative service (when appropriate) and student advising.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs Faculty participate in the establishment and functioning of a governance system at the department and college levels in accordance with the applicable unit and college bylaws. HP faculty can also participate in University-level academic governance activities pursuant to the Bylaws for Academic Governance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs faculty may contribute to the academic management of departments, units and/or the colleges by developing and recommending policy related to faculty affairs, student affairs, academic records, and academic fiscal management. Institutional service also includes academic activity such as student advising and curriculum development.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <h3>E. Other Faculty Roles</h3>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">While patient care services (medical, nursing, surgical, psychiatric, psychological, etc.) are basic to the role of an HP faculty member, such services are not exclusive of other service functions that parallel those of other University faculty members, i.e. facilitating and conducting public service education and outreach, committee and administrative duties. Health Programs faculty, in accordance with University policy and regulations, can serve as valuable resources and provide services by working with government, industry, public and private organizations. Full time Health Programs faculty have the right to engage in a limited amount of non clinically related outside work for pay in accordance with University policy and regulations (Outside Work for Pay, Michigan State University Medical Service Plan ‐ Colleges of Human and Osteopathic Medicine, Michigan State University College of Nursing Practice Plan, College of Veterinary Medicine Practice Plan).  </p>
         <p xmlns="">A more detailed description of the responsibilities expected of University faculty is included in the statement on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities in the Faculty Handbook (excluding the section on tenure).<br/>
