         <p xmlns="">HP appointments are made in units and/or departments reporting through the deans of the medical and nursing colleges to the Provost. Health Programs faculty might also be appointed in the deans' offices and in other units or programs which originate out of the deans' offices.</p>
         <p xmlns="">HP faculty may be appointed on an annual (AN) or academic (AY) year basis; appointments may be full time or part time.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Initial HP appointments are made for a one to five year period upon recommendation of the appropriate administrator (chair) as applicable to the dean. The dean will make a final recommendation to the Associate Provost for Academic Human Resources who will make the final decision.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Reappointments may be recommended for a one to five year period following a formal review and evaluation. This review process will be completed at least 90 days prior to the end date of an individual's current HP appointment (see section VI. C).</p>
         <p xmlns="">If a faculty member is not to be reappointed, he/she must be notified in writing at least 90 days in advance of the end date of the current appointment (see section VI.D).</p>
         <p xmlns="">Although there is a strong, good faith commitment by the department to fulfill the terms of the contract, a lack of funds is a legitimate reason for termination during the contract, as well as a decision not to renew a contract. If termination occurs during the term of the appointment, the faculty member will be provided written notice 120 days before the termination date.</p>
         <p xmlns="">HP faculty will not be dismissed due to capricious action by the University, college or department prior to the end date of the appointment. However, this assurance does not protect HP faculty who engage in activities which are grounds for dismissal pursuant to those listed in Section X.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Health Programs faculty are covered under the terms of the Faculty Grievance Policy (FGP).<br/>
