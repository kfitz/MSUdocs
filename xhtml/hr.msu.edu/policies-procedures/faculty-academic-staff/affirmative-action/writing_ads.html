               <li>
                  <p>The credentials which each applicant is expected to submit (e.g., curriculum vitae, publications, number and types of references) may be included in the position description or in a letter to be sent to applicants who apply for the position or who have been nominated.</p>

                     <li>
                        <p>The stated deadline for the receipt of applications must be strictly followed. Usually, the postmark of the applicant's letter of application must precede or be the same as the deadline in the advertisement. Flexibility in posting can be achieved by referencing "preferably by" before the closing date. This provides for posting deadline flexibility while giving applicants a reasonably precise closing date; or the statement "Late submissions will be considered if suitable candidates are not identified by the deadline," may be used.</p>

                  <p>the statement, "Persons with disabilities have the right to request and receive reasonable accommodation"</p>

                  <p>the statement, "Michigan State University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer," or "Women and minorities are encouraged to apply."</p>

         <p xmlns="">Naturally, nothing in the position posting/advertisement may be discriminatory or restrict equal opportunity (e.g., "applicants under 30 preferred," "recent graduates preferred," "applicants from the Northeast preferred"). <br/>It is preferable to publish or distribute position descriptions early in the academic year so that hiring decisions may be made in sufficient time to allow an individual to complete his or her institutional responsibilities elsewhere, and make professional and personal plans. In the case of dual career couples, this will allow the applicant's spouse or significant other ample time to look for new employment (see "<a title="Dual Career Couples"
               href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/dual_career.html"
               target="_blank">Dual Career Couples</a>").</p>
         <p xmlns="">Before advertising the position or undertaking the search, the unit administrator is responsible for ensuring that the Academic Position Request has been approved by the Provost.<br/>
