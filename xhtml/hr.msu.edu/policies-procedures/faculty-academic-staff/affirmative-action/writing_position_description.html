A well-conceived and well-written position description will also aid the search committee at the interview stage. Since interview questions must be job-related they should flow from the elements of the position description.</div>
         <p xmlns="">While position descriptions may vary widely, descriptions of academic positions which are submitted as part of the position approval process must include the following elements:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>rank and/or title; <br/>
                  <ul>
                     <li>You may wish to remain flexible on the rank; e.g., "associate or full professor". A position request for a tenure system position at the rank of associate or full professor requires special justification.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>department; <br/>
                  <ul>
                     <li>For an administrative or supervisory position, the office or individual to whom that position reports should be included.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>appointment basis; i.e., academic year or annual year</li>
               <li>appointment status; <br/>
                  <ul>
                     <li>e.g., tenure system, fixed term, continuing appointment system, fixed term but potentially tenure system</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>percent employment, if less than 100%;</li>
               <li>description of duties;</li>
               <li>specific qualifications such as degree, license and experience requirements;</li>
               <li>areas of specialization if applicable;</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">In developing a position description, it is beneficial to examine closely the requirements that have been enumerated to be certain that they are not simply the result of traditional practices but are genuine job-related activities that are necessary to perform the required duties. Rigid physical requirements, for instance, which are not necessary for a position may exclude persons with disabilities from applying.<br/>
