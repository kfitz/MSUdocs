Elements of support for hiring minorities, women and persons with disabilities include:</div>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Continuous recruiting mode to allow units to recruit in broader areas of activity and/or in advance of projected retirements;</li>
               <li>Continuous advertisement of positions in the tenure system at variable ranks, and as applicable, with broadly defined job descriptions to advance more flexible responses to recruitment opportunities. Units are encouraged to seek candidates from within academe and from non-traditional sources such as government and business;</li>
               <li>The Office of the Provost will work in partnership with the colleges to provide transitional funding for underrepresented group members until future retirements occur.</li>
               <li>The Office of the Provost will consider requests for special set-up funds for faculty from underrepresented groups.</li>
               <li>In some cases a search committee will identify a woman, minority, or person with a disability as an outstanding candidate, but an offer is not extended to that individual because he or she is highly ranked but is placed behind another candidate because of specifics of program needs or other requirements. Or, a search committee may find two well-qualified women, minorities, or persons with disabilities for the same position. On a case by case basis, the Office of the Provost, through a partnership with the colleges, may provide some of the funding necessary to hire the second individual.</li>
            </ul>
