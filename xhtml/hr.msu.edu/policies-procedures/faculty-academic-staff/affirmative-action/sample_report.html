         <p xmlns="">Graduate student and clerical/technical evaluations reflect the general trends above. Based on these data and our in-depth interactions with the candidates, the search committee made, seconded and discussed the following motion: Drs.________________________ and ________________________ are acceptable candidates for the chair position of _______________________________. Dr. ________________________ is not an acceptable candidate. Seven members favored the motion; one member opposed the motion. The opposition was in reference to considering Dr. ___________________ an acceptable candidate because of a weak understanding of __________________________ and possible concerns regarding the extent of commitment to affirmative action. Brief summaries and comparisons are provided on the next pages to elaborate on the search committee/faculty evaluations of the candidates.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr._____________________________</p>
         <p xmlns="">Strengths: excellent interpersonal skills; good affirmative action record; excellent administrative record; extensive linkages and ties in the professional field; thorough and well prepared.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Limitations/weaknesses: limited experience in academic environment; little knowledge of outreach efforts; somewhat limited knowledge of (key sub discipline).</p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr._____________________________</p>
         <p xmlns="">Strengths: good research record in area of expertise; good visibility because individual is a co-author of a widely used text; potentially good administrative abilities; committed to affirmative action.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Limitations/weaknesses: lacks interpersonal skills; faculty felt individual is brisk, abrasive, overly aggressive and not capable of interacting with peers in a non-threatening manner; appears to have a superiority and possessiveness attitude for those under direction rather than encouraging a team spirit.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr._____________________________</p>
         <p xmlns="">Strengths: excellent publication and grants record; good administrative record; nationally recognized in discipline and in sub-specialty circles; a proven administrator in an organization similar to MSU.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Limitations/weaknesses: inexperienced in some aspects of the field; somewhat weak in knowledge of outreach; commitment to affirmative action less strong than others.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr._____________________________</p>
         <p xmlns="">Strengths: excellent interpersonal skills; very organized and very thorough; good administrative record; good affirmative action record; good visibility because individual is an author of a widely used text.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Limitations/weaknesses: no serious limitations/weaknesses; needs to be more aggressive in establishing outside contacts for research purposes and national visibility for the department.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>COMPARISONS OF THE CANDIDATES</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">While Drs. _______________, _____________ and _______________ are all very acceptable to the department, Dr. _____________ was not regarded quite as highly. Dr. ___________ would be closely involved in the day-to-day operations of the department, whereas Dr. _____________ would delegate more responsibilities and put more energy into matters which would promote the strength and visibility of _______________, the colleges and MSU. Dr. _______________ appears to be a quick learner and would quickly overcome the limitations/weaknesses listed. Dr.______________'s administrative style would be somewhere between the styles of _____________ and _____________. Of the three, Dr. ________________ is best known in the field. All three of these candidates are articulate and good communicators.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr. _______________ and Dr. _______________ have superior interpersonal skills.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Dr. _______________ is adamant regarding the need to continue some research while chairing the department. Some faculty do not see this as a problem, but some see this as a potential red flag. This concern should not prevent the individual from being seriously considered, but it did need to be brought to your attention.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The faculty, staff and students were overwhelmingly negative to Dr. _______________. His/her style (interpersonal skills and attitudes) was objectionable and it is clear that it would be a mistake for Dr. _______________ and for MSU if he/she were appointed as the chair of __________________.</p>
         <p xmlns="">As members of the search committee we feel we have completed our duties, but we remain available, either as a group or individually, to provide more input regarding the candidates or the search process. If we can assist in recruitment, we would be pleased to do so.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Sincerely,</p>
         <p xmlns="">__________________________, Chairperson</p>
         <p xmlns="">Search Committee, Dept. of _____________________</p>
         <p xmlns="">c: _____________________</p>
