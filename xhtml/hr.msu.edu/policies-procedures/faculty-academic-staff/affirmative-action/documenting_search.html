Records must be kept for at least three years after the date of appointment, by mandate of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). These must be kept so that they will be available for review by the Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives (OIII) and OFCCP. The search committee determines how it will accomplish its record keeping responsibilities, including who will maintain records of the search, as well as how and where the records will be kept during the search.</div>
         <p xmlns="">An academic unit must be able to demonstrate that it has made a "good faith" effort to recruit women and minorities. Among the records that must be retained to do this are the following:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Academic Position Request plus a copy of all advertisements used to announce the position;</li>
               <li>Affirmative Action Report including:
<ul>
                     <li>a listing of where the position was posted;</li>
                     <li>an indication of the extent to which nominations were solicited from colleagues and professional organizations;</li>
                     <li>a record of the efforts that were made to enlarge the pool of candidates;</li>
                     <li>Demographic information on all members of the search committee (name, academic rank/title, ethnic identification, and gender)</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>copies of sample letters used in the process;</li>
               <li>the core questions asked in the interview;</li>
               <li>applicant file (letter of application/nomination, curriculum vitae, reference letters, etc.);</li>
               <li>for each applicant who is not on the final list, specific job-related reason(s) along with supporting documentation</li>
               <li>a summary evaluation for each final candidate. This may be accomplished by retaining rating sheets, interview evaluations, ranking summaries, or any document used in the evaluation process. The reasons must be concrete and directly related to the requirements of the position description (e.g., "research and scholarly activities too limited"; "did not have five years of teaching experience"; "lacked experience in scenic design"; "refused offer for personal reasons"). See "<a title="Sample Search Committee Report"
                     href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies-procedures/faculty-academic-staff/affirmative-action/sample_report.html"
                     target="_blank">Sample Search Committee Report.</a>"</li>
               <li>minutes of search committee meetings. These may be worth having particularly if a problem arises. The minutes should include all important committee decisions to help document consistent procedures and to prevent bias from tainting a search. Minutes are important in case of a discrimination suit to demonstrate that a committee followed its own rules consistently and treated all candidates fairly. These records must be retained by the unit for at least three years after the date of appointment.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">In compliance with federal rules and regulations, each unit of the University is responsible for completing the Affirmative Action Report for faculty and academic staff which documents the disposition of all candidates considered for a position.<br/>
