            <strong>III. UNIVERSITY POLICIES (<em>Cont.</em>)</strong>
            <br/>
            <em>
               <br/>The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on April 9, 1993 and revised on December 5, 2003, April 13, 2007, and October 30, 2015.<strong>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
               </strong>
            </em>
            <strong>Article I. Purpose</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Michigan State University’s scholarly community-building efforts occur within the context of general societal expectations, as embodied in the law.  The University, consistent with its policies and governing law, promotes institutional diversity and pluralism through mechanisms such as affirmative action, within an over-arching strategy promoting equitable access to opportunity.  The University’s commitment to non-discrimination is the foundation for such efforts.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Article II.</strong> <strong>Applicability</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">This policy states expectations for institutional and individual conduct. It applies to all University community members, including faculty, staff, students, registered student organizations, student governing bodies, and the University's administrative units, and to the University's contractors in the execution of their University contracts or engagements,<sup>1 </sup>with respect to the following:</p>
         <ol xmlns="">
            <li>All educational, employment, cultural, and social activities occurring on the University campus;</li>
            <li>University-sponsored programs occurring off-campus, including but not limited to cooperative extension, intercollegiate athletics, lifelong education, and any regularly scheduled classes;</li>
            <li>University housing; and</li>
            <li>Programs and activities sponsored by student governing bodies, including their constituent groups, and by registered student organizations.</li>
         </ol>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Article III.  Prohibited Discrimination</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Unlawful acts of discrimination or harassment are prohibited.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In addition, the University community holds itself to certain standards of conduct more stringent than those mandated by law. Thus, even if not illegal, acts are prohibited under this policy if they<sup>2 </sup>:</p>
         <ol xmlns="">
            <li>Discriminate against any University community member(s) through inappropriate limitation<sup>3</sup>
               <strong> </strong>of employment opportunity<sup>4 </sup>, access to University residential facilities, or participation in educational, athletic, social, cultural, or other University activities on the basis of age, color, gender, gender identity<sup>5</sup> , disability status, height, marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight; or</li>
            <li>Harass any University community member(s) on the basis of age, color, gender, gender identity, disability status, height, marital status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight.</li>
         </ol>
         <p xmlns="">These prohibitions are not intended to abridge University community members' rights of free expression or other civil rights.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Article IV. Informal Resolution</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Informal resolution of disputes, through consultation provided by offices serving the University, is encouraged.<sup>6</sup> Informal resolution is typically used when a claimant asks to participate in an informal resolution, requests anonymity, does not consent to participation in an investigation, or the alleged conduct, even if it does not rise to the level of a policy violation, suggests the need for remedial, educational, or preventive action.  Participation in informal resolution is voluntary, and either party may terminate the informal resolution process at any time.  If a party terminates attempts at informal resolution, or the parties are unable to resolve the matter informally, a formal review of the complaint will begin.<sup>7 <br/>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Article V.  Complaints and Investigations</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Complaints under this Policy are processed and investigated by the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) pursuant to the OIE Complaint Procedures.  Allegations involving gender discrimination, including sexual and gender-based harassment, assault, and violence, are processed and investigated pursuant to the Relationship Violence &amp; Sexual Misconduct (RVSM) Policy.</p>
