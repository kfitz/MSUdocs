            <em>The following policy was accepted by the Board of Trustees on September 20, 1970 and revised on June 12, 1987:</em>

         <p xmlns="">Any member of the instructional staff<sup>2</sup>
            <strong>
               <sup> </sup>
            </strong>who fails to fulfill any provision of the University's <em>Code of Teaching Responsibility</em> shall be held accountable.</p>
         <p xmlns="">It is the responsibility of the department chairpersons, school directors, and deans to ensure that students are provided the instruction to which they are entitled. All absences by instructional staff should be covered by other instructional staff, where possible and appropriate, so that students will not lose instructional time.</p>
         <p xmlns="">It is the responsibility of department chairpersons and school directors to determine if services have been withheld without proper cause and, if so, to report the precise details of such alleged withholding of services. This report should be made to the dean of the college, with a copy to the Provost, and should include information as to the total load of the instructional staff member so that an estimate can be made of the percentage of service that has been allegedly withheld. The Provost or designee shall review the contents of the report with the dean of the college and the applicable department chairperson/school director and shall discuss the matter with the affected instructional staff member.<sup>3 </sup>The Provost or his/her designee shall determine if the withholding of services was improper and may direct an appropriate deduction from the instructional staff member's salary. The instructional staff member, academic staff member, or graduate assistant shall be informed of this action in writing.</p>
         <p xmlns="">If the faculty or academic staff member believes that the action is a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of existing University policies and legislation, he/she may initiate a grievance under the <a title="Faculty Grievance Policy "
