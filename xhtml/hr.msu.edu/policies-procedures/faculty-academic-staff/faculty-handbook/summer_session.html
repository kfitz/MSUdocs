            <em>The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 26, 1991.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty members appointed on an academic year basis may be assigned teaching, research or public service duties for the summer term in addition to fall and spring terms. Summer instructional appointments will normally be limited to the equivalent of one regular summer session. Faculty members may also elect to pursue additional teaching, research or service assignments up to a total maximum effort not to exceed 3/9 of the previous academic year appointment. Regular summer instructional appointments for a summer session, either Summer A or Summer B, will be compensated at the rate of 2/9 (22.2%) of the previous year's salary, with a maximum earning level of 3/9 of the previous academic year's salary. (No benefit premiums or base retirement contributions are made on this pay.) Faculty members appointed on an academic year basis may perform summer duties involving teaching, research and public service in exchange for one of the other semesters providing:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>The summer teaching is done before the term off.</li>
               <li>The teaching and academic advising program of the department is not disadvantaged.</li>
               <li>A "Non-Standard AY Duty Period Agreement" is completed and signed in advance by the faculty member, chairperson, dean, and Provost.</li>
               <li>Requests to exchange summer term duties for an assignment during the regular academic year must be agreed reasonably in advance of the summer term in which exchange duties are to commence.</li>
               <li>Exchange duties may involve teaching, research, and public service responsibilities.</li>
               <li>Exchange duties may involve a period of one year or longer periods subject to a memorandum signed in advance by the faculty member, chairperson, dean, and Provost. Such agreements must have an ending date, but additional arrangements providing for exchange duties may be renegotiated subject to approval of the relevant parties.</li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty members serving on the Academic Council or on standing committees of the Academic Council are expected to be available fall and spring terms unless specific alternative arrangements have been approved.<br/>
