            <br/>
            <br/>The Constitution of the State of Michigan provides that the Board of Trustees shall have general supervision and direction of the University. The eight members are elected from the state at large for a term of eight years, two being elected each even-numbered year. The president of the University is appointed by the Board and by constitutional provision is the presiding officer of the Board.</div>
         <p xmlns="">Generally, the Board meets monthly, except as otherwise scheduled by the Board. In accordance with Michigan law, the Board establishes an annual calendar for its regular meetings; meetings are open to the public except for limited closed sessions. Items requiring Board action should be submitted to the Provost's office about three weeks before each Board meeting.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In addition to the President the following University officers are present at Board meetings: Provost, Vice President for Finance and Operations and Treasurer, Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies, Vice President for Student Affairs and Services, Vice President for University Development, Vice President for Governmental Affairs, General Counsel and Vice President for Legal Affairs, Vice President for University Relations, Secretary of the Board and Executive Assistant to the President, Executive Director of the MSU Alumni Association, and Senior Advisor to the President for Diversity and Director, Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives. Five faculty members and four students selected by their respective constituencies also attend Board meetings.<br/>
