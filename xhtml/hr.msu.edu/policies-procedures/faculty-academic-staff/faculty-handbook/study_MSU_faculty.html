            <em>The following policy was approved by the Academic Council on May 1, 1973. Policies and procedures were reaffirmed by the Graduate Council on February 14, 1977, with the instruction that the dean of The Graduate School monitor programs of all faculty members pursuing MSU doctorates and notify any faculty members not in compliance.</em>

               <li>No MSU faculty member with the rank of professor, associate professor, or assistant professor, or instructor in the tenure system, may earn a doctoral degree at MSU. Any waiver of this regulation may be made only by agreement of the Graduate Council and the provost prior to the beginning of the program.</li>
               <li>Full-time faculty members may carry an average of four credits a semester with a maximum of 8 credits in the academic year. Fees are based on the number of credits carried, in the same manner as for other students.</li>
               <li>A full-time faculty member may enroll in credit courses as an auditor with prior approval from the chairperson of the department offering the course and from the faculty member's department chairperson. No charge is made.</li>
               <li>This regulation removes the master's degree from the prohibition and it does not apply to the graduate-professional degrees: D.O., D.V.M. M.D.</li>
