            <strong>VII. FACULTY AND ACADEMIC STAFF BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PROGRAMS (<em>Cont.</em>)</strong>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>OPTIONAL BENEFITS (<em>Cont.</em>)</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <em>This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies with an effective date of September 1, 1983.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Upon official appointment, postdoctoral fellows will be issued an appropriate identification card that will qualify them for such benefits as library privileges, staff parking, and staff rates at University cultural and athletic events.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Postdoctoral fellows who are not otherwise covered on another policy (e.g., as a spouse or a dependent) are required to have individual health plan coverage. Postdoctoral fellows are not eligible for University contribution toward benefits but will, if appointed for at least nine months, qualify for one of the University's health plans under the provisions stipulated below.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The following health plans are available to postdoctoral fellows: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Community Blue PPO or Blue Care Network (BCN-HMO). Information about these plan options can be obtained from MSU Human Resources. Funds for a postdoctoral fellow's individual health plan premiums can be provided as follows:</p>
         <p xmlns="">Institutional Grants: Health plan coverage contributions are to come from the grant budget, normally an allowance, for grants provided by Michigan State University as well as by external agencies. The department should request funds from the external granting agency for this purpose. If using funds for health plan coverage is contrary to the granting agency's policy, then contributions for such coverage will come from the department or from funds that may be made available in the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. In the latter case, approval must be obtained from that office prior to accepting the individual for postdoctoral study.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Individual Grants: If a cost-of-education allowance to the University accompanies the grant, the contributions will come from the portion of that allowance allocated to the department or college. That allocation will be increased, if necessary, to cover such contributions. If a cost-of-education allowance is not provided from the granting agency, contributions will come from the department or from funds that may be made available in the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In the latter case, approval must be obtained from that office prior to accepting the individual for postdoctoral study.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Family health plan coverage is not an appropriate charge on postdoctoral grants; however, a postdoctoral fellow may elect personally to pay the differential between individual and family options. Exceptions are permitted in cases where a sponsor allows costs associated with family health coverage as part of the postdoctoral award. In such an instance, the allowable family health coverage costs must be included in the award for the postdoctoral fellows who have families and who are eligible for family health coverage at Michigan State University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Arrangements should be made with MSU Human Resources for payment of health plan premiums either by individual payment or by arrangements to charge these costs to an appropriate account.<br/>
