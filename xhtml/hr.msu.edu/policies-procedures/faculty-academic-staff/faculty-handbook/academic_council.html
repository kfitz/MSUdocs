            <strong>II. ORGANIZATION</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>The University Council is composed of the members of Faculty Senate, selected pursuant to section 3.3.1. of the Bylaws for Academic Governance, the Appointed Council, all faculty serving as Chairpersons of College Advisory Committees, the Chairperson of the Athletic Council, members of the Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) selected pursuant to section 3.2.3.1., members of the Council of Graduate Students (COGS) selected pursuant to section 3.2.3.2., Chairpersons of University-level Standing Committees, The Steering Committee, the President, the Provost, and designated ex officio members in 3.2.1.2.</div>
         <p xmlns="">The functions of the University Council are to consider and act upon all matters brought before the group by the Steering Committee, the president, and the provost, and to provide a forum for the dissemination of information and exchange of views regarding University policy. Consultation upon matters related to the general welfare of the University is provided by the University Council. The president, or in the president's absence, the provost, presides at meetings of the University Council. The Secretary for Academic Governance is the secretary of the University Council. The University Council must meet at least once each month during the academic year and more often at the call of the president or Steering Committee. The agenda is prepared by the Steering Committee, in consultation with the president or the provost.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Most of the issues debated by the University Council are considered by its various standing committees: The University-level Committees on Academic Governance, Student Affairs, Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies. For information about composition, procedures and functions of the various standing committees see Section 4 of the Bylaws for Academic Governance. Faculty and student members of the University-level standing committees are selected in accordance with the procedures specified in the Bylaws for Academic Governance.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Bylaws are an integral component of the governance system adopted in each academic unit. These documents describe faculty consultation and advisement in the units and normally describe reappointment, tenure and promotion procedures.<br/>
