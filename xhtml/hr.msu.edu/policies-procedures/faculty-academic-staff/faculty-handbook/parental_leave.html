            <strong>IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES <em>(Cont.)</em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <em>This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on December 27, 2000 and revised on January 1, 2017.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty and academic staff who are appointed on at least a 50 percent basis for nine months or more are immediately eligible for parental leave in accordance with this policy.  This policy is to be read in coordination with the Short-Term Disability policy and the Family and Medical Leave Policy for faculty and academic staff.<sup>1</sup>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty and academic staff are eligible to receive up to six (6) weeks of paid parental leave in connection with the birth of a child.  Faculty and academic staff who adopt a child younger than age six and/or not attending school full-time are eligible to receive up to six (6) weeks of paid parental leave.  Additional unpaid leave may be available for the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Policy and/or the policy regarding Leaves of Absence Without Pay for faculty and academic staff.</p>
         <p xmlns="">In situations where the University employs both parents of a newborn/adopted child as faculty/academic staff,  each may have six (6) weeks of paid parental leave under this policy.  Parents employed in the same department or school should plan the timing of their leaves in consultation with the chairperson, school director or dean.  Depending on the circumstances, additional unpaid leave may be available pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Policy or with the approval of the academic unit administrator.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Requests for parental leave must be accompanied by evidence of adoption or by a health care provider's medical certification that provides the projected delivery date.  Faculty and academic staff are expected to make leave arrangements with the academic unit administrator as far in advance as possible. The timing of parental leave can be arranged to provide some variation in scheduling the leave of absence period before and/or after the projected delivery/adoption date in recognition of constraints associated with academic responsibilities.  Faculty and academic staff are encouraged to schedule leave periods with input from the academic unit administrator regarding the needs of the individual unit.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Leave for purposes relating to ongoing child care is not to be confused with parental leave or medical leave of absence relating to pregnancy and child birth.  Faculty and academic staff may arrange to use available vacation time or leave without pay for child care purposes with the approval of the academic unit administrator.</p>

            <strong>Footnote:</strong>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>
               <sup>1 </sup>
            </strong>In cases where a faculty/academic staff member provides medical certification that she is unable to work due to a disability related to pregnancy, childbirth and/or recovery, such absences will be covered by the Short Term Disability Policy for faculty and academic staff.  Normally, short term disability leave related to pregnancy, childbirth and/or recovery is for 6 weeks but may be longer with proper medical certification. <br/>
