         <p xmlns="">Visiting faculty/scholars may be eligible to enroll for individual health plan coverage with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan or Blue Care Network (BCN-HMO). In addition, visiting scholars are also eligible to enroll for health plan coverage with the Blue Care Network student health plan. These health plan options may be available in recognition of the fact that many visiting faculty/scholars are enrolled in national or other private institutional health programs in the U.S.A. or abroad, which do not provide them coverage when appointed at MSU. Individuals eligible for this program are visiting faculty/scholars: 1) who are appointed without pay or with pay on appointments of less than 50% time and/or for less than nine months, who will return to their home university, agency, firm or other institution after a limited appointment period at Michigan State University; and 2) who are currently enrolled in a health plan which is not available to them while appointed at Michigan State University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Information relating to the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan or Blue Care Network health plan options available to visiting faculty/scholars may be found at <a title="Student Insurance"
