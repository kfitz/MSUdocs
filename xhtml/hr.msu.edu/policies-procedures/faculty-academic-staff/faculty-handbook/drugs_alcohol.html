         <p xmlns="">Consistent with state and federal law, Michigan State University will maintain a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance.<sup>1</sup>
            <strong>
               <sup> </sup>
            </strong>The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs and alcohol are prohibited on any property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of Michigan State University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline, any employee involved in the unlawful use, sale, manufacturing, dispensing or possession of controlled substances, illicit drugs and alcohol on University premises or work sites, or working under the influence of such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The employee must notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) calendar days after such conviction. Failure to provide such notice will subject the employee to discipline up to and including dismissal pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline. The employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, who will report the incident to the Office of Human Resources, Academic Human Resources or Student Employment Office.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Michigan State University supports and sponsors programs aimed at the prevention of substance abuse by University employees. The Employee Assistance Program provides preventative programs and counseling for employees experiencing substance-dependency problems. Assistance is available on a voluntary basis. Leaves of absence to obtain treatment may be obtained under the medical leave provision of the appropriate labor contract or policy.</p>
