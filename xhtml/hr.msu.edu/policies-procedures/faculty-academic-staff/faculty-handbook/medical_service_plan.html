            <strong>IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES <em>(Cont.)</em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <em>The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 30, 1976.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Medical Service Plan for the Colleges of Human Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine provides a common framework within which professional fee income generated by faculty members of the two colleges is managed. This plan does not apply to the College of Veterinary Medicine. The plan was approved by the Board of Trustees on July 30, 1976, and takes precedence over all previously existing plans.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The purpose of the plan is to improve the means to supplement basic support for programs of the medical colleges; sustain and enhance faculty incentives to engage in patient care which benefits educational programs, the public and the professional development of the faculty; and make it financially feasible to recruit and retain highly capable faculty necessary to develop and sustain quality programs.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The principles of the Medical Service Plan include:</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>The plan policies, rules and procedures and practices conform to established University policies, procedures and practices.</li>
               <li>Plan income is University revenue.</li>
               <li>Involvement of departmental chairpersons and faculty shall conform to the <em>Bylaws for Academic Governance</em>.</li>
               <li>Plan income shall cover costs of the plan relating to administration, billing, and collecting, and costs of practice.</li>
               <li>Net income shall be used as authorized within approved guidelines of the Health Services Related Component (HSRC) and for program support.</li>
               <li>A ceiling limit shall be set for personal income that is commensurate with comparative medical schools and allowing for differences in compensation for rank, experience, specialty, and professional competencies.</li>
               <li>Under the plan faculty may engage in outside work for pay under established University policy.</li>
               <li>The plan will be subject to annual review during the first three years of its operation and thereafter reviewed at least once every three years.</li>
            </ol>
