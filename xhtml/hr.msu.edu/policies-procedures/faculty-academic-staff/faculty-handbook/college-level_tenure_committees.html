            <strong>IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES <em>(Cont.)</em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <em>This policy statement was issued by the Office of the Provost on January 26, 2005, to be effective with the 2005-06 academic year.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>University Policy</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Each departmentally organized college is required to establish a college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committee that is charged to provide advice to the dean about department/school recommendations for reappointment, promotion and tenure.  The reappointment, promotion and tenure process is a critical component in enhancing academic excellence and building a progressively stronger faculty - faculty who meet continuously higher standards to assure enhanced quality within a national and international context.  Establishment of college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committees is in accordance with Section 2.1.2.2.of the <em>Bylaws for Academic Governance</em> that states "deans are responsible for educational, research, and service programs of the respective college or separately reporting unit. This responsibility includes budgetary matters, physical facilities, and personnel matters in his or her jurisdiction taking into account the advisory procedures of the college."  College-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committees will enhance the dean's ability to make reappointment, promotion and tenure recommendations that improve academic unit quality.</p>
         <p xmlns="">It is recognized that practices and procedures in colleges may vary; however, all college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committees must incorporate, at a minimum, the principles included below.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>Principles</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Each departmentally organized college must include in its written materials governing the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process a procedure for establishing a college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure review committee, including methods for selecting committee members and how the committee will function.  At a minimum, the following principles should be clearly defined by the bylaws or established polices and procedures of each college.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ol>
               <li>Eligibility for membership on college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committees is limited to individuals appointed in the tenure system at Michigan State University, except that because of special appointment circumstances, the Colleges of Human Medicine, Osteopathic Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine may have committee members holding fixed term or Health Programs appointments.</li>
               <li>Committee members may be selected through an election and/or appointment process.</li>
               <li>Candidates shall be informed about the nature of the materials to be reviewed by the committee and whether the committee may request additional information/commentary.</li>
               <li>The College determines the committee's operating rules and procedures, including form of advice, e.g., secret ballot vote, ranking, commentary, etc., and method for selecting a committee chairperson.</li>
               <li>In providing advice on recommendations that involve the award of tenure or promotion to full professor in the tenure system, committee member  participation is limited to tenured faculty or solely to full professors, respectively.</li>
               <li>The role of the committee is to provide advice to the dean on all reappointment, promotion and tenure recommendations required or proposed by departments/schools.  It may also provide comments on department/school standards, criteria and procedures for reappointment, promotion and tenure, and other matters as requested by the dean.</li>
               <li>Candidates are reviewed according to the criteria and standards in department/school bylaws or other relevant documents, college bylaws or other relevant documents (if any), and the University's statement on "Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Recommendations."</li>
               <li>The dean of the college will provide faculty members and the Office of the Provost with information concerning the composition, membership, role and functions of the college-level reappointment, promotion and tenure committee.</li>
            </ol>
