            <strong>IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES <em>(Cont.)</em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <em>This policy was issued by the Office of the Provost on February 11, 1997 (to be  effective Fall semester 1997) and revised on March 3, 2003; it reflects advice by the Faculty Council and the University Committee on Faculty Affairs.</em>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">All units must have procedures for written evaluation of tenure system faculty at all ranks to support the annual merit process and to provide a basis for a clear statement of performance expectations and accomplishments. It is recognized that provisions and practices in units may vary; however, all evaluation procedures must incorporate, at the minimum, the principles included in this model policy for regular faculty review, and must be applied uniformly to all faculty in the unit.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>I. Principles</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">While some variation may occur in the approach to reviews, the following principles as implemented by unit procedures are to be followed by unit administrators (i.e., Deans, Chairpersons and Directors) and faculty. In the case of faculty with joint appointments, a lead unit administrator shall be designated. The process should be clearly defined by the bylaws or established personnel policies and procedures of each academic unit.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul type="A">
               <li>Each tenure system faculty shall be evaluated on an annual basis and informed in writing of the results of his/her review by the unit administrator.</li>
               <li>Each unit shall have clearly formulated and relevant written performance criteria and shall provide these at the time of appointment, and subsequently as necessary, to all faculty to clarify expectations.</li>
               <li>Faculty shall be informed of all factors used for evaluation, the evaluation of their performance on each of these factors and the relationship between their performance and decisions on merit salary adjustments and, if appropriate, on reappointment, promotion and tenure. Faculty are entitled to have all their assigned duties given weight in the evaluation.</li>
               <li>These annual assessments of faculty reviews shall be reflected in recommendations to the Provost's Office regarding reappointment, tenure, and promotion.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>II. Guidelines for Implementation</strong>
            <ul type="A">
               <li>Units should initiate the annual review process early enough so that the full process, including feedback to faculty, may be completed before the beginning of the fall semester.</li>
               <li>Each faculty member shall submit a written summary of activities for the appropriate period of time to the unit administrator in a timely manner prior to the review. These materials will be shared with the faculty in accordance with unit bylaws and procedures.</li>
               <li>If unit bylaws or procedures provide for performance evaluation by peer review committees, unit administrators shall rely on the advice of this designated group, in addition to their own judgment.</li>
               <li>Unit administrators or their designees, no later than 3 months after completion of the evaluation, shall provide to the faculty member a written evaluation of her/his overall performance. Whenever appropriate, such evaluations shall contain constructive and explicit recommendations and clarify expectations of what is needed to make additional scholarly progress in the tenure system.</li>
               <li>If, after receiving the written review, the faculty member disagrees with its content or chooses to provide additional documentation or comment, the faculty member shall have an opportunity to respond to the review. Any additional written faculty comment and/or documentation which is submitted within one month of receipt of the written review shall become part of the documentation for the review.</li>
               <li>The full documentation for this written review, including the faculty member's response, shall be placed in the faculty member's unit personnel file.</li>
               <li>Meetings between faculty members and unit administrators are encouraged prior to the written summary to provide feedback about expectations and evaluation. Each faculty member shall have the right to meet in person with the unit administrator or designee after the written review is received.</li>
            </ul>
