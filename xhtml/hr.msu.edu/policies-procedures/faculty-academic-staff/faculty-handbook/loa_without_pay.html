            <strong>VII. FACULTY AND ACADEMIC STAFF BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PROGRAMS (<em>Cont.</em>)</strong>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>WITHOUT PAY</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty/academic staff granted an approved leave of absence without pay may continue in force the optional benefit programs by paying the full cost of all premiums. The same University contribution toward the dental premium continues for up to 24 months while on a leave of absence without pay. Coverage for other optional benefits may be continued by making cash payments for as long as the approved leave continues. Payments for benefits to be kept in force should be made directly to Michigan State University and sent to the <a title="Contact Info" href="https://www.hr.msu.edu/contact/index.html">Human Resources Solutions Center</a> no later than the first day of the month for which the payment is due. Optional benefits not maintained will be reinstated upon return to active employment in an eligible benefits status.</p>
         <p xmlns="">A faculty/academic staff member on a Family Medical Leave (FMLA) will have their health and dental benefits continued at the same level and with the same premium contribution as prior to the FMLA leave. Any share of premiums which had been paid by the individual prior to the leave must continue to be paid during the leave, otherwise coverage will be canceled.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Faculty/academic staff member contributions for the 403(b) Base Retirement Program will be suspended during the period of the leave.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Provisions are available to faculty/academic staff members on leave due to acceptance of prestigious awards or fellowships for the continuation of applicable University benefits. Additional information should be requested from MSU Human Resources. (See <a title="Continuation of Benefits"
