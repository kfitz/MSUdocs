               <a name="ExpandedLife"> </a>Basic Employer Life (Death Benefit)</strong> <br/>Eligibility <br/>The University provides a life benefit payable to beneficiaries of faculty/academic staff appointed 50 percent time or more for nine months or more. This benefit is effective immediately upon appointment.</div>
         <p xmlns="">Coverage<br/>Eligible faculty/academic staff members are provided coverage equal to one year's base salary up to a maximum of $50,000. Beneficiaries are those designated by the faculty/academic staff member or the same as designated in the Employee-Paid Life program. If no beneficiary has been designated, payment will be made to the survivor(s) in the first surviving class of those that follow: a) spouse; b) children; c) parents; or d) brothers and sisters. If none survives, payment would be made to the estate.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Cost<br/>No enrollment application is necessary and the entire cost of this benefit is paid by the University.</p>

               <a name="LTD"> </a>Long-Term Disability</strong>
         </div>
         <div xmlns="">Eligibility<br/>Coverage under the Long-Term Disability Plan is available for faculty/academic staff appointed full-time for nine months or more who have been employed for 12 FTE service months. Faculty appointed with tenure (or on the effective date of the award of tenure) or with the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams/National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (FRIB/NSCL) continuing appointment status are immediately covered under this plan. Eligible faculty/academic staff may receive benefits provided by the Long-Term Disability Plan after 180 days of continuous disability.</div>
         <p xmlns="">Coverage<br/>The benefits provide a disabled faculty/academic staff member (as defined by the master contract) with a monthly income equal to 60% of the basic monthly salary (minus any workers' compensation, social security or auto wage loss benefits, if applicable) up to the limits defined in the plan. In addition, the program assumes both the faculty/academic staff member's contribution and the University's contribution to the base retirement program for as long as the individual remains entitled to Long-Term Disability benefits. The plan provides an annual cost-of-living adjustment and a minimum benefit of $50.00 per month.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Cost<br/>The cost of this benefit is totally paid by the University.</p>
         <p xmlns="">Other Benefit Information<br/>If the faculty/academic staff member is unable to work due to total disability and is eligible for benefits under the Long-Term Disability Plan, a University premium contribution will be continued for the health, dental and employee-paid life programs for the faculty/academic staff member during the period of disability benefit payments.</p>
