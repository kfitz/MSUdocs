            <strong>VI. RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ENDEAVOR <em>(Cont.)</em>
            </strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">The Strategic Partnership Grant (SPG) program supports larger projects that are aimed at establishing long-term centers of excellence on the campus. Funding under this program generally requires that the project be multidisciplinary, that it be in an area of high priority for the units involved, and that it have a high probability of attracting external support for a sustained period of time. The funding limit for this program is $400,000 total for projects up to three years in duration.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Humanities and Arts Research Program (HARP) provides two types of internal funds to support faculty who are conducting important research, creative and performance projects and activities in the arts and humanities. The limited funding is designed to 1) support faculty for projects that seem likely to enhance the reputation of the faculty member and the university where external support is not generally available, and 2) support projects that will be using the funds to seek extramural funding.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Scholarship Development portion of HARP makes awards for research, creative, and performance projects of the kind that will help faculty achieve their career milestones of reappointment, tenure, promotion, and annual merit evaluation. The funding limit for this program is $25,000.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Scholarship Production portion of HARP is a subvention program whose purpose is to help subsidize the costs of book publication, permissions to use copyrighted materials, CD recording and production, the creation of mounting of exhibits and other expenses associated with producing the results of a completed research or creative project. The funding limit for this program is $7,000.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Discretionary Funding Initiative (DFI) supports faculty who require funds to bridge grants or complete additional studies needed for the resubmission of a grant application. The submission of applications to the DFI program is a two step process. Faculty will be required to submit a request to their Research Associate Dean, and applications supported by the college will then be recommended to the Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. The maximum DFI award from the OVPRGS is $50K, and there is an additional requirement of a 20% match to be provided by the unit or college. It should be noted that, although the recommendation of the College will be one of the primary criteria for the decision on funding DFI project, not all projects recommended will necessarily be funded.  Faculty should refer to the <a title="Cord web site"
               href="http://www.cord.msu.edu/"
               target="_blank">Council of Research Deans (CORD) website</a> (www.cord.msu.edu) for the list of Research Associate Deans. Each college has developed their own process for submitting and reviewing applications at the college level.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Targeted Support Grant for Technology Development (TSGTD) provides funding for the enhancement, optimization and/or other development of selected technologies that have commercial potential as identified by MSUT Management and Technology Managers. These grants will accelerate the process of transforming promising technologies into products that are responsive to market demand, and should increase the commercial value of technologies and enable MSU to retain a greater share of ownership. The amount of funds awarded and the duration of the award varies. MSUT Tech Managers are responsible for identifying and nominating all TSGTD projects.</p>
