            <strong>II. ORGANIZATION</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>Under its bylaws and Michigan's Constitution, the Board of Trustees has the responsibility to develop a free and distinguished university and to promote the welfare of mankind through teaching, research and public service. The Board of Trustees exercises final authority and responsibility for University governance within the bounds fixed by the State Constitution.</div>
         <p xmlns="">In exercising its responsibility the Board delegates to the president, and through him or her, to the faculty appropriate authority and jurisdiction over matters for which they are accountable to the Board. In other cases, for example, faculty appointments, promotions, and tenure, the Board does not delegate, but instead instead looks to the faculty for recommendations. The specific powers delegated to the faculty are detailed in the <em>Bylaws of the Board of Trustees</em>.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The Board also has declared its intention to give due consideration to the opinions of students on matters directly related to their interest.</p>
         <p xmlns="">It is important to specify the manner and process by which the faculty and students develop and communicate their views to the President and the Board. These <em>Bylaws for Academic Governance</em> are designed to provide an effective system for the participation of faculty and students in the development of policy on academic matters.<br/>
