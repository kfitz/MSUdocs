The individual archivist will be notified of required reappointment and continuous appointment deliberations and must submit a dossier to the Director of the University Archives for consideration by the Reappointment, Continuous Appointment and Promotion (RECAP) Committee. Probationary appointment periods are calculated from August 16 of the calendar year in which the appointment is effective.</p>
         <h3 xmlns="">
            <strong>Archivist I</strong>
         </h3>
         <p xmlns="">An Archivist I is initially appointed in the continuous appointment system for a probationary period that expires on the fourth August 15 after the appointment year and may be reappointed for an additional probationary period of three years. If at any time during these two probationary periods an Archivist I is promoted to the rank of Archivist II, continuous appointment is granted. If not promoted to Archivist II at the conclusion of the second probationary period of three years, the individual is ineligible for an additional reappointment. Individuals appointed as Archivist I without continuous appointment have the option of requesting promotion to Archivist II with continuous appointment at any point (during a normal review cycle) prior to the conclusion of the stipulated probationary appointment period. A negative decision on such a request shall not preclude consideration for reappointment at the normal time.</p>
         <p xmlns="">To be considered for reappointment to a second three-year probationary period, the archivist must submit a dossier no later than the third July 1st after his or her appointment year. The initial probationary appointment will terminate on its specified end date unless the archivist is reappointed for a second probationary period.</p>
         <h3 xmlns="">
            <strong>Archivist II</strong>
         </h3>
         <p xmlns="">An Archivist II is appointed in the continuous appointment system for a probationary period that expires on the fourth August 15 after the appointment year. If an Archivist II is reappointed, continuous appointment is granted. Individuals appointed as Archivist II without continuous appointment have the option of requesting reappointment at any point (during a normal review cycle) prior to the conclusion of the stipulated probationary appointment period. A negative decision on such a request shall not preclude consideration for reappointment at the time specified upon appointment.</p>
         <p xmlns="">To be considered for reappointment with continuous appointment status, the archivist must submit a dossier no later than the third July 1st after his or her appointment year. The probationary appointment will terminate on its specified end date unless the archivist is reappointed with continuous appointment.</p>
         <h3 xmlns="">Archivist III</h3>
         <p xmlns="">An Archivist III is granted continuous appointment (appointment for an indefinite period without a terminal date) from the date of appointment at that level.<br/>
