The University currently pays the full cost of the Delta Dental premium for individuals working full-time. Employees will pay a premium for the Aetna dental, even if working full-time. The coverage is briefly described below:</p>
                           <p>The Delta Dental plan pays 50% of the usual reasonable and customary costs of most dental services up to a maximum payment of $600 per person per calendar year. Orthodontia is covered for persons under age 19 with a 50% co-payment and has a $600 lifetime maximum.</p>
                           <p>The Aetna Dental Maintenance Organization (DMO) utilizes primary care dentists to lower the cost – it is a managed care dental plan. Members select a primary care dentist (PCD) from the provider network and visit their PCD as needed for treatment and care. There are fixed co-pays for services and there is no annual or lifetime benefit maximum or an annual or lifetime deductible.</p>

                           <p>The coverages are briefly described below:</p>

                              <strong>Community Blue:</strong>
                           </p>
                           <p>Community Blue is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and allows you to choose whether you receive health care services from an in-network or out-of-network provider. There is a nationwide network of participating PPO physicians and hospitals that allow you to choose any physician in the network without requiring a referral from a primary care physician. The in-network deductible is $100/individually and $200/family for the calendar year. For out-of-network services, the deductible is $250/individually or $500/ family for the calendar year with higher out-of-pocket costs, usually a 20% co-pay.</p>
                           <p>
                              <strong>Blue Care Network (BCN):</strong>
                           </p>
                           <p>BCN is a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), meaning that enrollees will select and work closely with a primary care physician to manage care. MSU members can seek services from both in-network and out-of-network (non-contracted) providers. Deductibles, co-insurance and prior- authorization requirements apply in some circumstances. The in-network deductible is $100/individually and $200/family. The out-of network deductible is $500/individually and $1,000/family for the calendar year. A majority of the services are subject to a 20% co-insurance after meeting the deductible, up to a maximum of $3,000 individually or $6,000/family per calendar year.</p>
                           <p>
                              <strong>Consumer Driven Health Plan/Health Savings Account:</strong>
                           </p>
                           <p>CDHP/HSA is a high-deductible health plan (annual deductible for single coverage is $2,000/$4,000 family) with a Health Savings Account (MSU contributes up to $750 annually); you may also contribute on a pre-tax basis up to the IRS limits. With this plan, you pay a higher deductible first before the plan pays medical and prescription benefits. Preventative care and certain generic prescriptions for chronic conditions are covered at 100% with no deductible or co-pays. The provider network is the same as the BCBSM plans.<br/>

                           </p>
                           <p>The prescription drug plan is administered through CVS Caremark. CVS Caremark has a large network of over 55,000 participating retail pharmacies, including some of the largest drug store chains. Employees may choose to purchase their prescriptions at a participating retail pharmacy, at an MSU pharmacy or through CVS Caremark’s mail order program. <a title="See Copays for more detail"

                           <p>An individual entering executive management status from an MSU position in which service credits toward retirement status have been earned shall be given immediate credit toward the fifteen year Executive Management retirement requirement in proportion to the ratio that such prior service bears to the 25 year vesting requirement for all other University employees, rounded up to the next half year.</p>
                           <p>Access to retiree health coverage is based on employment date:</p>
                           <p>Executive Managers hired prior to July 1, 2005 and meeting the minimum University retirement requirements will remain eligible to maintain health and dental coverage and receive a University contribution toward the premiums based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at retirement.</p>
                           <p>For Executive Managers hired on or after July 1, 2005 and before July 1, 2010, the University will contribute to the lowest cost health plan’s single rate for which the employee/retiree is eligible. (The contribution is based on the full-time equivalent (FTE) service months at the time of retirement).</p>
                           <p>Executive Managers appointed on or after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for a University contribution to health care benefits. Retiree health coverage is available to purchase through the University.</p>
