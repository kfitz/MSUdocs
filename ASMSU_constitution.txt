ASSOCIATED STUDENTS of MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY
TITLE I INTRODUCTION
ASMSU has a responsibility to make every effort to recruit, hire, and promote a staff that is representative of the diversity of Michigan State University’s undergraduate student population. This Personnel Code – consistent with accepted personnel policies – shall govern and provide a basis for the personnel operation of this organization. It shall be the responsibility of the ASMSU Director of Human Resources for implementation and enforcement of this Personnel Code.
This Personnel Code shall govern all ASMSU bodies – including the General Assembly, Standing Committees, Boards, departments, interns and staff (whether compensated employees, elected representatives, or volunteers). Because all members of the ASMSU bodies are also students at Michigan State University, they are expected to adhere to the university’s policies.
Representations made on behalf of ASMSU are to be neither misleading, incorrect, nor inherently false, and are to reflect organizational policy and opinion.
TITLE II
PUBLIC RELATIONS POLICY
Effective communications with media shall be accomplished both responsively and pro-actively through the Director of Public Relations who serves as the chief spokesperson for the organization in preparing public responses. The Director of Public Relations, and the ASMSU President are the primary representatives of the opinions and viewpoints of ASMSU. Any personal opinions made by members of ASMSU must reflect that those opinions do not reflect the viewpoints of the organization.
A. All officers, representatives, and staff must consult with the Director of Public Relations before making any statements on behalf of ASMSU.
The Director of Public Relations summarizes all media interactions to the Chief of Staff and ASMSU President. It is the policy of ASMSU to respond to media inquiries accurately and in a timely manner to help promote general understanding of ASMSU’s recent activities and issues. All staff should notify the Director of Public Relations regarding all inquiries from the media. All Directors and Office of the President

ASMSU shall at no time engage in any unlawful discriminatory act or practice against persons on the basis of age, color, creed, gender, marital status, national origin, physical characteristics, political persuasion, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status. If any compensated employee, elected representative, or volunteer engages in any such behavior, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
TITLE IV HARASSMENT POLICY
ASMSU shall have a Sexual Harassment Policy that is strictly enforced. This General Harassment Policy shall be consistent with the policy of Michigan State University and all applicable state and federal laws.

This may include, but is not limited to, harming another person, threatening another person or their property, or exhibiting behavior that causes a person to feel extreme distress due to the behavior of another individual. Personnel of ASMSU are unconditionally prohibited from engaging in any type or severity of harassment.
Because sexual harassment is made unlawful by the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, and the Michigan Elliott-Larson Civil Rights Act, ASMSU shall also have a Sexual Harassment Policy that is strictly enforced. Sexual harassment in an organization setting includes, but is not limited to, verbal or physical behavior such as unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexually related favors, or any other unwanted sexual behaviors that make an individual feel uncomfortable or create a hostile working environment. Sexual harassment may also include circumstances in which a person is offered advancementor is held back from advancement for giving ordenying a
