    <h1>Article 4: Non-Academic Hearing Board Structures</h1>
	        <div class="post">
            <div class="post-title"></div>
            <h2 class="post-info"></h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Consistent with the fundamentals of fair play in any judicial process is an opportunity for those accused to be heard by their peers. What follows is the foundation and structure of a representative peer review structure, embedded within the hearing procedures outlined within this document.  This Article describes the composition and jurisdiction of all non-academic hearing boards.  Academic hearing boards are described in Article 6 of this document.</p>
<p><strong>I. General Guidelines</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A.</strong> <em>Student Membership and Selection. </em>A nomination committee composed of undergraduate and graduate members from each of the hearing boards outlined in this Article, as well as representatives from RHA, ASMSU, and COGS, will be responsible for recruiting and nominating a full complement of students to serve on each hearing board. At its discretion, the committee may include faculty members in the nomination process. The committee will be advised by a designee of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Services, who shall be a non-voting member. The committee will develop and follow written procedures to govern the nomination process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once the nomination process is complete, the committee must submit the names of the candidates for appointment to the appropriate governing body (see Section I.B below) no later than the sixth week of spring semester.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>B.</strong> <em>Student Appointment/Reappointment. </em>COGS shall be responsible for the appointment of graduate students to the hearing boards described in this Article. RHA shall be responsible for the appointment of residence hall hearing boards members. ASMSU shall be responsible for the appointment of undergraduates to remaining hearing boards described in this Article. All student appointments shall be made by the tenth week of spring semester.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each governing body shall make provisions for filling mid-semester vacancies on an interim basis prior to completion of the appointment process. If such vacancies have not been filled within two weeks, the Provost may appoint student members to fill them. The Provost may also appoint students to fill vacancies if students are unable to serve during the summer or if interim members are necessary to meet quorum requirements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>C.</strong> <em>Faculty and Staff Membership and Appointments. </em>Faculty members on the hearing boards described in this Article shall be nominated pursuant to the <em>Bylaws for Academic Governance</em> and appointed by the President. Faculty members may serve no more than two consecutive full-term appointments. Staff members on the hearing boards described in this Article shall be nominated by the Executive Vice President for Administrative Services and appointed by the President. Staff members may serve no more than two consecutive full-term appointments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Provost may appoint members from the faculty and staff ranks to fill vacancies in the event that mid-semester openings occur, members are unable to serve during the summer, or interim members are necessary to meet quorum requirements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>D.</strong> <em>Advisors. </em>Each hearing board described in this Article shall have an advisor designated by the Vice President. The role of the advisor is to see that each hearing board follows the provisions outlined in this document. The advisor shall serve as an ex-officio and non-voting member of the hearing board.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>E.</strong> <em>Code of Operations. </em>All hearing boards shall follow a written code of operations that will be reviewed and approved by UCSA. The codes of operation of student-only hearing boards described in Section II of this Article must be approved by their related major governing groups. Each code of operations must be consistent with this document, including confidentiality provisions, procedures for determining whether a complaint warrants a judicial hearing, and how a hearing is to be conducted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The codes of operation shall, at a minimum, require that board members be trained, provide for the appointment of board members to specific board roles, and establish procedures for the assessment of conflicts of interest and removal of board members if necessary. The codes of operation shall also define the quorum for the hearing board, which in no case shall be less than five board members or 50% of the currently appointed membership, whichever is less. The codes of operation shall also address procedures for expedited consideration of urgent cases in which a temporary restraining action is sought.</p>
<p><strong>II. Student-Only Hearing Boards</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. Complaints alleging violations of General Student Regulations, Student Group Regulations, or University policies by individual members or constituent groups within ASMSU or COGS where the possible sanction would not be expected to result in suspension or dismissal from the University;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. Complaints between ASMSU and COGS that allege a violation of either governing body&#8217;s constitution, bylaws, or policies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Student-Faculty-Staff Hearing Board does not have jurisdiction over cases involving academic misconduct, except as described in Article 5, Section I of this document.</p>
