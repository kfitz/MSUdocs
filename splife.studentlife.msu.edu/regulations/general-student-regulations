                <p>*To be implemented January 1, 2018</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br />
</strong></p>
<p>General student regulations shall be those regulations established within the University community (students, trustees, administrators, faculty, and staff) to secure the safety of members of the University community and University facilities, maintain order, and ensure the successful operation of the institution. Such regulations shall apply to all students regardless of class level, place of residence, or group affiliation as well as to all governing bodies, governing groups, living groups, and registered student organizations (<a href="http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/academic-freedom-for-students-at-michigan-state-university/article-8-regulations-policies-and-rulings">Article 8, Section I.A <em>Student Rights and Responsibilities </em>document</a>).</p>
<p>The regulations apply to students and student groups while on the land governed by the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, when students or student groups are engaged in University-sponsored or student group-sponsored (student governing groups and registered student organizations) activities off campus, or when the conduct of a student poses a clear and present danger to the health or safety of person or property.</p>
<p>*The regulations relating to protection of individuals apply without reference to where the activity occurs when the alleged misconduct involves hazing or acts causing or explicitly threatening to cause serious bodily harm to other individuals.</p>
<p>The regulations relating to scholarship and grades, University functions and services, and University property apply without reference to where the activity occurs. Because technology is constantly changing teaching, learning, and administrative processes, it is understood that the general principles that govern these regulations should be extended to apply to new and unanticipated situations.</p>
<p>The University adjudicates alleged violations of these regulations only after its Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution Office receives a formal complaint. Any member of the University community may file a complaint involving the alleged violation of these regulations by a student or student group. The University through its internal judicial system shall maintain jurisdiction over these regulations and conduct hearings in accordance with established University procedures. In the application of the regulations, it is intended that one be held accountable for conduct that fails to meet the standard of what a reasonable and prudent person would or would not have done under similar circumstances.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>1.00 PROTECTION OF SCHOLARSHIP AND GRADES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The principles of truth and honesty are fundamental to the educational process and the academic integrity of the University; therefore, no student shall:</p>
<p><strong>1.01</strong> claim or submit the academic work of another as one&#8217;s own.</p>
<p><strong>1.02</strong> procure, provide, accept or use any materials containing questions or answers to any examination or assignment without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>1.03</strong> complete or attempt to complete any assignment or examination for another individual without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>1.04</strong> allow any examination or assignment to be completed for oneself, in part or in total, by another without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>1.05</strong> alter, tamper with, appropriate, destroy or otherwise interfere with the research, resources, or other academic work of another person.</p>
<p><strong>1.06</strong> fabricate or falsify data or results.</p>
<p>(See also:<a href="http://splife.studentlife.msu.edu/regulations/student-group-regulations-administrative-rulings-all-university-policies-and-selected-ordinances/integrity-of-scholarship-and-grades"> <em>Integrity of Scholarship and Grades </em></a>.)</p>
<p><strong>2.00 PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS</strong></p>
<p>Physical security and an environment free of harassment are necessary for individuals if they are to successfully pursue their educational endeavors and fulfill responsibilities; therefore, no student shall:</p>
<p><strong>2.01</strong> cause or threaten physical harm to another or endanger the physical safety of another.</p>
<p><strong>2.02</strong> engage in sexual misconduct as defined by University policy.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><strong>2.03</strong> engage in domestic violence or dating violence as defined by University policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.04</strong> continuously or persistently intimidate another individual so as to coerce that individual into some action or avoidance of action.</p>
<p><strong>2.05</strong> engage in repeated, unwanted verbal or written communication or personal contact with another individual, including stalking or bullying.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><strong>2.06</strong> harass any other individual in violation of the Anti-Discrimination Policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.07</strong> engage in hazing.</p>
<p><strong>2.08</strong> possess or use any firearms, explosive materials, incendiary device or other dangerous objects or substance without proper University authorization.</p>
<p><strong>2.09</strong> obstruct or disrupt the activities of another individual as protected by law, ordinance, regulation, or policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.10</strong> enter or remain in another individual&#8217;s place of residence or work without permission of that individual or without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>2.11 </strong>possess or use any drug prohibited by federal or state laws.</p>
<p><strong>2.12</strong> manufacture, produce, sell, exchange, or otherwise distribute any drug prohibited by federal or state laws.</p>
<p><strong>2.13</strong> possess or use any alcoholic beverages, except as permitted by state law, University policy, and University ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>2.14</strong> manufacture, produce, sell, furnish, exchange or otherwise distribute any alcoholic beverages except as permitted by state law, University policy, and University ordinance.</p>

<p><strong>3.00 PROTECTION OF REGISTERED STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNING GROUPS<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The functions of student groups serve to extend and provide support for the learning environment; therefore, no student shall:</p>
<p><strong>3.01</strong> obstruct or disrupt the activities or functions of a group as protected by law, ordinance, regulation, or policy.</p>
<p><strong>3.02</strong> continuously or persistently intimidate a group so as to coerce that group into some action or avoidance of action.</p>
<p><strong>3.03</strong> provide false information to a group for the purpose of gaining membership, service, or privilege.</p>
<p><strong>3.04</strong> represent a group falsely or use the resources of a group without proper authorization.</p>

<p><strong>4.00 PROTECTION OF PROPERTY</strong></p>
<p>It is important that the property of individuals, student groups, and the University be protected if the University and the members of the academic community are to engage in their activities and to effectively discharge their responsibilities; therefore, no student shall:</p>
<p><strong>4.01</strong> damage, deface, or destroy the property of another person or the University.</p>
<p><strong>4.02</strong> tamper with or misuse University fire or safety equipment, including, but not necessarily limited to, fire extinguishers, fire hoses, and alarm systems.</p>
<p><strong>4.03</strong> copy, take, or use the property of another without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>4.04</strong> remove property or goods from their assigned place without proper authorization or accept or convey property or goods which have been procured without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>4.05</strong> use any University facility, equipment, or materials except for their authorized purposes.</p>
<p><strong>4.06</strong> procure, alter, damage, remove, manufacture, or use, any University key card, lock, password, or other security device without proper authorization.</p>
<p><strong>4.07</strong> without proper authorization enter or remain in any University building or on University property.</p>
<p><strong>4.08</strong> place posters, signs, or handbills except on one&#8217;s own personal property or in areas authorized by the University.</p>
<p><strong>4.09</strong> sell or otherwise commercialize intellectual property of the instructor or University-provided class materials (e.g., notes, homework, tests) without the written consent of the instructor.</p>
